This is my personal blog for Tank Studios.  I started with the casper skeleton for docpad.

The details for an empty Casper theme are below.


# [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) skeleton for [DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad)
The default personal blogging theme for Ghost.


## Getting Started

1. [Install DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad)

1. Clone the project and run the server

``` bash
mkdir my-website
cd my-website
docpad run --skeleton casper
```

1. [Open http://localhost:9778/](http://localhost:9778/)

1. Start hacking away by modifying the `src` directory

## What's Different from Ghost - Casper?

1. This skeleton operates in a more "single author" mode.  Author details are used throughout the site, and can be edited in docpad.coffee.  Because of this there is no "author posts" pages.

2. Minor logic tweak to the masthead / cover images.  If it's not present on a post or page, the default site "cover" will be used instead.  This eliminates a display issue with the menu button (white) on a white background.

3. Site details are all managed in docpad.coffee, at the top.

4. Navigation links are manually managed in docpad.coffee.  This was the best way to ensure flexibility and make the navigation "generatable".

5. Paged posts are possible in this version.

6. Marking active links uses the url of the page, or 'sections'.  If a pages 'section' and a link's section match, the link will be marked active.  For the nav, this means the line in the link will be solid.
