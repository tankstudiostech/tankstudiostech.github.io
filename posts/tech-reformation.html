    Recently a few friends and I started up a podcast!  We have eight episodes currently
    released, and we are releasing a new episode every week!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is the podcast about? Where can you listen? How did we create it?</strong>
    If you are curious to know the answer to any of those, read on!
</p>

<h3>What is the Podcast About?</h3>

<p>
    The podcast is called <em>Tech Reformation</em>, with the tagline &quot;Where the world of technology meets the
    worldview of Christianity.&quot;  Four guys who love and follow Jesus and enjoy technology get together
    each week to merge the two together. 
</p>
<p>
    Technology is a huge part of our world today.  People are spending more time with electronics than
    ever before, new technologies are coming out every day, and many use them without thinking.
    We decided to think! <strong>We take the time to examine anything to do with technology,
    exploring the world&#39;s view and discussing the Christian&#39;s view.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Also, anything that is a huge part of the culture is going to have a
    huge impact on our Kingdom work.</strong>  Some technology is built specifically for ministry,
    some technology is built for secular purposes but can be used for ministry, and some
    technology should be avoided altogether.  <strong>We look for ways we can best use technology
    for the glory of God.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In the first segment, <strong><em>Tech You Should Know</em></strong>, we explore the week&#39;s technology news.
    Next up comes <strong><em>Tech You Should Use</em></strong> where we recommend a useful technology
    for your daily life. Finally, in <strong><em>Theology From the Headlines</em></strong>, we discuss current hot topics through the lens of
    a Christian worldview.
</p> 
<p>
    Currently we have discussed
    <ul>
        <li>Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality</li>
        <li>Automating Jobs</li>
        <li>Smartphone Usage</li>
        <li>Drones</li>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Free Internet</li>
        <li>Ad Blockers</li>
        <li>Internet Mob Justice</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Where Can I Listen?</h3>

<p>
    Interested in listening? <strong>The best place to start is our website at <a href="http://www.techreformation.com/">techreformation.com</a>!</strong> We post
    every episode to the site along with show notes containing links to the articles we discuss.
</p>

<p>
    Also, you can download a podcast app to your mobile device (I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict">Podcast Addict</a> on Android)
    and search &quot;Tech Reformation.&quot;  We&#39;re the only podcast that appears!  <strong>Most podcast apps allow you
    to download episodes so you can listen to them without Wi-Fi.</strong>
</p>

<h3>How Did it Start?</h3>

<p>
    It all started when a good friend of mine, Ben Robin, asked if I had any interest to do a podcast
    about technology and theology.  <strong>I enjoy both subjects, so I say I would be interested.</strong>  Time goes on, and he
    gets married and moves to Tennessee.  I forget about the podcast.
</p>

<p>
    A couple of weeks after the move, Ben sets up a meeting with me on Google Hangouts.  I expect he just wants to
    catch up since we haven&#39;t talked since his wedding.  <strong>You can imagine my surprise, then, when I
    realize two other guys I don&#39;t know will be joining the call, and we will be discussing the
    creation of a podcast!</strong>
</p>

<p>
    We have our first meeting where we just get to know each other a bit.  The two others are named
    Craig and Derek.  <strong>One fact is immediately apparent; Craig and Derek have never met. The only
    connection between us all is Ben.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    We converse for an hour, and then Ben has to leave.  Out of curiousity, I then
    ask Craig and Derek how they know Ben.  <strong>I learn that Ben tweeted, &quot;Anybody want to
    host a podcast with me?&quot;, and they were interested to join!</strong>  So, other than a few internet
    messages, they didn&#39;t know Ben either!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Luckily, they are both awesome guys.</strong>  Over the next months, we slowly began preparing all the little
    details that need to be put into place, and on August 9th we released our first podcast!
</p>

<p>
    We have been recording every week since.  We have completed eight episodes and an introduction
    episode, and it has been a blast to create.  <strong>It&#39;s like hanging out with 3 friends to talk about
    Jesus for an hour, except we record it.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
    If you like technology and/or love Jesus, check us out! I think you will enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
    Any podcasts that you enjoy listening to yourself?  I&#39;d be interested in hearing about them!
</p>

<p>
    See you next time!
