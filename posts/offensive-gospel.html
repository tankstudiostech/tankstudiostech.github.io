      <p>
    Recently I told a <a style="color: cornflowerblue;" title="The Day My Car Panicked" href="/posts/broken-car.html">story about my car getting fixed</a>.  During that time, I shared the gospel with the mechanic.
    The mechanic told me he has no interest in following Jesus.  He does not even believe Jesus
    walked the Earth!  <strong>However, he explained that he enjoys hearing messages from a well-known preacher.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    His explanation confused me.  <strong>What about the gospel could a person
    who completely rejects the Godhood and Lordship of Christ enjoy?</strong>  The only explanation is that pastor
    must have not preached the gospel.
</p>

<p><h3>The Offenses</h3></p>
<p>
    Paul claims that in sharing the knowledge of Christ, &quot;we are the aroma of Christ in God both to those who are being saved
    and those who are perishing. To one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life.&quot; 2 Cor. 2:16.
    <strong>When we explain the gospel of Christ, we share the gospel in love, but people will not always love the gospel.</strong>
    Please join me in Romans 5:6-11 as I explain why.
</p>

<p><h4>We Exist because God Allows It</h4></p>
<p>
    &quot;For while we were still weak, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.&quot; Rom. 5:6.
</p>
<p>
    We want to be independent, but the gospel explains that we are weak.
    <strong>In fact, Rev 4:11 says we would stop existing if Jesus stopped wanting us to exist.</strong>
    Jesus could also stop our heart from beating or stop giving us air to breath.
    The gospel offends our pride in our independency.
</p>
<h4>We have Rebelled</h4>
<p>
    &quot;God shows His love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; Rom 5:8.
</p>
<p>
    We want to be blameless, but the gospel explains that we have broken God&#39;s law.
    <strong>We are &quot;by nature children of wrath&quot; (Eph 2:3). There is no one good, not even one (Ps. 14:3).</strong>
    The gospel offends our self-righteousness.
</p>
<h4>We will be Condemned</h4>
<p>
    &quot;Since therefore we have been justified by His blood, much more shall we be saved by Him from
    the wrath of God.&quot; Rom. 5:9.
</p>
<p>
    We want to be free of responsibility, but the gospel explains that
    we will be condemned for our rebellion against our Creator.  Murdering only once
    brands us as a murderer, deserving punishment.  Breaking God&#39;s law (sinning) only once brands us a sinner, and
    we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Rom 3:23).  God is just, vengeance is His, He will repay (Deut 32:35).
    <strong>Justice will be served, evil will be destroyed, and God accomplishes this at judgement, condemning
    sinners to an eternity in hell.</strong>
    The gospel offends our desire to be free of responsibility for our evil.
</p>
<h4>We Cannot Save Ourselves</h4>
<p>
    &quot;For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more, now that
    we are reconciled, shall we be saved by His life.&quot; Rom 5:10.
</p>

<p>
    We want to be good enough on our own, but the gospel explains, as stated earlier, that
    we have all sinned and will have God&#39;s wrath poured out on us. We can do
    nothing to prevent that.  But Jesus did!  While we were DEAD in our sins, we were saved by grace
    through faith in Jesus Christ, not by works so that none may boast (Eph 2:8).  Praise Jesus for doing
    what none of us could do!  He lived a perfect life, and
    God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf so that in Him
    we might become the righteousness of God (2 Cor 5:21)!  <strong>By believing in Jesus we are legally made
    not guilty in the sight of God!</strong>
    The gospel offends our confidence in ourselves.
</p>
<h4>We Must Follow Jesus as Lord</h4>
<p>
    &quot;More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received
    reconciliation.&quot; Rom 5:11.
</p>

<p>
    We do not want to submit to anyone; we want to live a life where we simply eat, drink, and be merry (1 Cor 15:32), but the
    gospel explains that Jesus, being God in flesh
    (1 Tim. 3:16), demands our obedience.  Truly believing in Him requires us to accept Him as Lord of our life.
    We are made a new creation (2 Cor 5:17), our sin is crucified with Him on the cross, we are buried with Him in death, and we
    are risen to walk with Him in His resurrection to life (Rom 6:4).  <strong>Living lives our own way shows we have no love
    for Him and that we have never been justified and made new.</strong>  The gospel offends our authority over ourselves.
</p>

<p><h3>Conclusion - Jesus is Life</h3></p>
<p>
    I hope you see how this message is offensive to those who do not believe.  <strong>If there is no love for Jesus,
    nobody can find any of the above to be the &quot;good news&quot; believers know it to be.  When we as believers
    preach the gospel, we must preach it this way. Any other message will not save.</strong>  The gospel is the power
    of God for salvation to those who believe (Rom 1:16), but if someone comes with a different gospel,
    they will be accursed (Gal 1:8).
</p>

<p>
    If you do not follow Jesus as Lord, <strong>I BEG you on behalf of Jesus Christ, be reconciled to God!</strong>
    God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on YOUR behalf so that in Jesus you might become the
    righteousness of God (2 Cor 5:20-21).  Please believe.  Jesus came that we may have life and life in
    abundance (Jn 10:10).  He is the best master to have.  Go to Him, for He gives rest,
    His yoke is easy, and His burden is light (Matt 11:28-30).
