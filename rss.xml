            <title><![CDATA[The Day My Car Panicked]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h3>Car Problems</h3>
<p><strong>The Tankersley family seems to be cursed with car troubles.</strong>  to the extent a man wanted to write a book 
about our many difficulties. Discovering my car has another 
problem is like waking up to a shiny, new pimple on my face.  It is common enough to not be
surprising, but I wish I could just make it go away for good.</p>

<p><strong>Recently, a metaphorical pimple manifested in a most inconvenient way.</strong></p>

<h3>Locked Door</h3>
<p><strong>My car door lock had been finicky.  It was refusing to accept my key as the proper key.</strong>  I always managed to unlock the car, but
eventually I took it into a Honda dealer.  They fixed it...for a week.  But it once again began to be finicky.</p>

<p>I decided to stop locking my front car door.  I would every other door, just not the front.  My car helped me accomplish this plan
in that the automatic lock would lock all but the front door.</p>

<p><strong>Or so I thought...</strong></p>

<p>Pulling up to my office, I get out of the car and close the door.  Remembering I need to lock all but the
front door, I open the door again, hit the lock button, and let gravity close the door for me.</p>

<p>As it shuts, I suddenly realize that my car has betrayed me; <strong>it locked all 4 doors!</strong>  I attempt
to stick my fingers in the door before gravity finishes the dirty deed, but I am left only with a jammed finger
and the bitter taste of defeat.<p>

<p>I decide to deal with it later, but as I walk towards my office, I realize my phone is still in the car.
Not sure how long I have until phone withdrawal kicks in, I turn around and spend the next fifteen minutes,
key in the door, twisting, jamming, and begging.  <strong>Finally, I head into my office with no success.</strong></p>

<p>My wife is kind enough to pick me up at the end of the day.  We try her key to no avail.  I plan to try
again the next day.  If I cannot get the key into the door, I will call a person to pop the lock open for
me and then bring the car back to the dealership.</p>

<h3>Pop-A-Lock</h3>

<p><strong>At lunch the next day, I head to my car in prayer.</strong>  &quot;Father, it would be wonderful if You opened this door
for me.  I know You can.  It would save me $50 and the headache of having people come out
to open it.  So why not?  This is my attempt, and then I will call roadside service.
I trust Your plan and will.&quot;</p>

<p>Expecting a miracle, I continue jiggling the key, again to no avail.  <strong>Dejected, I call the Pop-A-Lock guy.</strong>
He comes and pops the lock open in roughly 30 seconds, completely shaking my confidence
that my locked car is actually safe.  <strong>I then open the door...and the car enters panic mode</strong>.</p>

<p>The security alarm honks constantly if the car is not unlocked properly, which I had no way to do!
The horn dies down after about 5 minutes, but
reopening a door or starting the ignition causes it to flare up all over again.  We set the alarm off
three times trying to solve the problem.  I am now the favorite person of all the businesses in the area.</p>

<p>The Pop-A-Lock man gives up, but he tells me he will wave the $45 fee of opening the door and
send a new guy out to replace my entire lock!  Thanking him, I turn to go inside...until I once again realize
my phone is still in the car.  I prepare myself for the hatred of all around me, open the door, grab my phone,
and walk away as my car repeatedly cries out its panicked alarm.<p>

<h3>The Repair</h3>
<p>A few hours later, a man comes to repair the door.  As he is repairing the door, we chat for about an hour.
<strong>In that time, I get to tell him about following Jesus, and I invite him to my church!</strong></p> 

<p>Once he fixes the lock, I ask about getting a remote key for keyless entry.  I learn I can at no extra cost!
For $130, a man comes to pop my lock, then another comes to replace my lock, and finally they make a third
trip to give me a remote entry key!  A dealership would price that around $300. <strong>If God had answered
my request to have the door opened, I would have paid way more money, I would have been without
a car for a few days, and I wouldn&#39;t have gotten to share the gospel.</strong>  I&#39;m glad God followed His plan rather
than answering my request in the way I asked.</p>

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3></p>
<p> In Philippians, Paul tells us to be anxious for nothing, but instead make our requests to God, and 
His peace that surpasses all understanding will guard our hearts.  Sometimes we see God work things out in an awesome way.
Sometimes we are left wondering why God didn&#39;t answer our request
the way we expected Him to answer.</p>

<p><strong>Paul doesn&#39;t tell us God will answer how we want.</strong>  Paul simply explains
we can have peace knowing that God has heard our request and will work all things together for good to
those who love Him and are called according to His purpose.  <strong>Obediently trusting Him with our requests will
give us peace and lead us closer to Jesus, and Jesus is worth more than time, money, and any
other created thing.</strong></p>

<p>So today, determine what is making you anxious, make your request to God, and trust that He
will work it out in a way that leads the most people to His Son.  <strong>If knowing Jesus more isn&#39;t an
appealing result, please seek to understand how Christians can say, &quot;I count all things as rubbish compared
to the joy of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed the story!  I look forward to any feedback, questions, or stories that you have to give!

            <title><![CDATA[Managing Your Life Projects and To-Do Lists with Trello]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Most of us have so many tasks to do we lose track of them all. We may make lists, but we often need the list when we don&#39;t have it, or we simply let it fall out of date.
<strong>Trello provides a free, easy way to create and manage tasks from wherever you are</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/trello/trello.PNG" alt="Trello Logo"></p>

<p>I have been using Trello for half a year now and have found it to be beneficial to practical life management.  Here is how.</p>

<h3>Trello: The Answer to Task Management Woes</h3>

<p><a title="Trello" href="http://www.trello.com/">Trello</a> allows you to manage tasks in a simple, stylish, and effective way. 
<strong>Trello can revolutionize your task lists in three ways: categorizing, detailing, and syncing</strong>.</p>

<p><h3>Categorizing</h3></p>
<p>On a paper task list, there are typically two categories: to-do and done.  Trello allows three levels of categorization.</p>

<p><h4>Boards</h4></p>
<p>First, similar tasks are categorized into Boards.  Boards are the highest level.  One board may contian all the tasks for the house.  Another board may contain all the tasks for the office.
<strong>Boards give clear distinctions between contexts</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/trello/trelloboards.PNG" alt="Trello Boards"></p>

<p><h4>Lists</h4></p>
<p><strong>Second, tasks within the context of a board, are grouped into lists</strong>.  These lists allow you to further organize tasks.  Want to be able to measure the progress of a task?  Then perhaps
you would organize your boards into progress lists, &quot;Not Started&quot;, &quot;In Progress&quot;, &quot;Almost There&quot;, and &quot;Done&quot;.  Would you rather, instead
further narrow down the context of your boards?  Your lists could then be, &quot;Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Garage&quot;, &quot;Living Room&quot;, and &quot;Bathroom&quot;.</p>

<p><img src="/img/trello/list.PNG" alt="Trello Lists"></p>

<p>But what if you want to measure both progress and context?  Labels solve that problem.</p>

<p><h4>Labels</h4></p>
<p>Finally, tasks can be attached with labels.  <strong>Tasks can have as many labels attached as
desired</strong>.  So, a red label could mean &quot;Not Started&quot;, a yellow label could mean &quot;In progress&quot;, and
a green label could mean &quot;done&quot;.</p>

<p><img src="/img/trello/listwithlabels.PNG" alt="List With Labels"></p>

<p>Alternatively, a red label could mean &quot;Kitchen&quot;, yellow &quot;Garage&quot;, green &quot;Living Room&quot;, and blue &quot;Bathroom&quot;.</p>

<p>All these categories can be used in whatever way you want!  Nearly all of my boards are categorized differently to suit my needs.</p>

<p><h3>Detailing</h3></p>
<p>With traditional pen and paper tasklists, there is not much room for details.  With too many details, the paper will get cluttered, and it will no longer be simple and succinct.
<strong>With Trello, you can get a clean tasklist when you only want an overview, but you then can get detailed tasks on further examination</strong>.</p>

<p>When looking at a Trello board, you can see details about a task at a glance.  You can see the list it
is on, the labels it has attached,
the due date you have set, and the people the task is assigned to.  These details are all added
elegantly so they only draw your eye when you are looking for them.</p>

<p><img src="/img/trello/complexlist.PNG" alt="Complex List"></p>

<p>When you click a task, you get the opportunity to see and add even more details!  Inside the task editor, tasks can receive checklists, images, comments, and a variety of other details.</p>

<p><h3>Syncing</h3></p>
<p>If you own a smartphone, your tasks are always on-hand.  Trello is a web-based application with apps on all smartphones.  <strong>Using Trello, 
you no longer have to carry a tasklist around with you</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, if there is a group of people you want working with you on the taskboard, members can be added to the board.  <strong>If one person changes a task, all members of the board immediately get the changes</strong>!</p>

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3></p>
<p>Trello has been a huge help to my wife and I in managing house and life projects.  <strong>What do you think?  Worth trying out, or do you already have a method you are happy with?</strong></p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Plastic for Dinner]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><h3>Bad Planning</h3></p>
<p><strong>I am not a chef</strong>.  I belive good chefs are artists. <strong>Good chefs know how to improvise.  I do not.</strong></p>

<p>My lovely wife does most of the cooking.  Everything she makes is delicious.  She has the ability to improvise.</p>

<p>This day, she was not arriving at the house until 6:15, and we had somewhere to be at 7:00, <strong>meaning it is my turn to cook.</strong>
I have roughly 7 meals I can make edible.  My planned dish for the evening: honey salsa chicken.</p>

<p><img class="small-image" src="/img/plastic-for-dinner/stove.jpg" alt="Open Stove"></p>

<p>I arrive home at 5:45 and begin preparing the ingredients.  With the ingredients prepared, I read the directions.
The final step: bake for one hour.</p>

<p><h3>Improvisation</h3></p>
<p>Dinner would be <em>ready</em> at 7:00.  <strong>Baking for an hour wouldn&#39;t
even give me time to finish it, much less eat it!</strong></p>

<p>Remember said inability to improvise?  I pull everything I have out of my improvisation skill
bucket and come up with a brilliant idea!</p>

<p>I call my wife.</p>

<p>...voicemail: &quot;Hi, this is Michelle Tankersley.&quot;</p>

<p>Having already used all my improvisation for the day, I am trapped with my idea.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Call</strong>: &quot;Hi, this is Michelle Tankersley.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Call</strong>: &quot;Hi, this is Michelle Tankersley.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Call</strong>: &quot;Hi, this is Michelle Tankersley.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Call</strong>: &quot;Hi, this is Michelle Tankersley.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>After five back-to-back calls, I decide she must not be picking up.  However, being determined to provide my wife with honey salsa chicken, 
I drink the dregs of my remaining improvisation, and, <strong>for the first time in my cooking history, I develop a plan!</strong></p>
<p><h3>Spilling the Nachos</h3>
&quot;I can cook it in a skillet!&quot;  Using a skillet on a stove top is much faster than baking, and it would get the job done!</p>
<p><img class="small-image" src="/img/plastic-for-dinner/stovetop.jpg" alt="Stovetop"></p>

<p>Being pleased with the idea, I rush to begin.  My enthusiasm quickly fades when I see the pan of leftover nachos from the night before, enjoying its place on our best working stove top.
<strong>As I pick it up to pour the crumbs into the trash, my phone rings.</strong></p>
<p>In a desire to get to the phone before I missed the call, <strong>I quickly scrape off the nachos...all over the floor.</strong>  &quot;No time!&quot; I think, throwing the nacho pan into the sink.
Before sprinting into the living room, I turn on the burner to let it warm.  I race to the living room, grab the phone, move my thumb to answer...and the ringing ends.</p>
<p>Seconds away.  Love it when that happens.</p>
<p><h3>Plastic Fumes</h3>
The call was from Michelle.  I call her back and this time she answers.  We have a chat about my idea, and she agrees I should continue with the plan.  Again excited
to create my delicious chicken, <strong>I return to the kitchen, only to find my cat, Tessie, enjoying a second dinner consisting of nacho crumbs.</strong>
Shooing her away, I get the broom out of the closet, toss the dust pan to the side, and begin furiously sweeping up the crumbs.</p>
<p>Finished, I look around for the dustpan.  My eyes land on it.  <strong>When tossing the dustpan to the side, it managed to settle right on top of the burner!</strong></p>
<p>Immediately pulling the dustpan off, I discover a nice hole burned through it, leaving behind a puddle of melted plastic still cooking on the burner.  Still, the dustpan works well enough to sweep up the nacho crumbs.</p>
<p><img class="small-image" src="/img/plastic-for-dinner/dustpan.jpg" alt="Burnt Dustpan"></p>

<p>The burning plastic is filling the air above the stove with smoke.  The air smelled just like cancer.  Delicious.</p>
<p><h3>Enjoying the Meal</h3>
I scrape the plastic off the burner with a grill cleaner and begin cooking the chicken.  Michelle returns home, and she is thankfully forgiving of my attempt to destroy everything we own.
<strong>The chicken finishes, we enjoy a nice, home-cooked meal, and we arrive at our destination at 7:05.  Victory!</strong></p>
<p><h3>Conclusion</h3>
We can&#39;t all be good cooks, and we don&#39;t all get to enjoy the smell of burning plastic, but we all know the sweet feeling of victory after countless defeats.
I thank God for reminding me of Phillipians 2:14 in the middle of this experience: &quot;Do all things without grumbling and arguing&quot;. Holding His Word in front of me, I stayed humored rather than annoyed.
I hope He continues working in me so that when life gets much messier than spilled nachos and burnt dust pans, <strong>I will find joy in knowing Jesus
as Savior and Lord, joy in what He did on the cross, and all trials will be nothing in the light of His saving grace.  That is &quot;life, and life in abundance.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed my story!  Any feedback or similar moments that you have to share?  Leave a comment!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[First Post!]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody!  Thank you for coming to Tank Studios Blog.  My name is Ryan Tankersley 
and I&#39;ll be the author of these posts.  Feel free to check out the <a title="About Page" href="blog.tankstudios.net/about.html">About Page</a> to see what I&#39;m all about.</p>
<h3>Wait, Haven&#39;t You Done This Before?</h3>

<p>...Yeah.  The first one, Tank Studios Tech Talk, was a primer to see if I enjoyed blogging.  <strong>I did, but I felt limited</strong>. 
First, the blog never felt like mine.  I&#39;m a software developer.  I wanted the site to be mine in the sense that I knew the code.  Blogger gave me 
a nice, pre-packaged template that I liked, but again, it never felt like mine.  I made this website using <a title="DocPad" href="http://www.docpad.org/">DocPad</a>.
DocPad makes creating websites with Html, JavaScript, and CSS much easier than simply starting from scratch, and I can change anything on this site
that I want to.</p>
<p>Secondly, I desired a broader scope than just Tech Talk.  <strong>Here I will be discussing three core subjects: Life, Tech, and Dev</strong>.
Each subject will be tagged appropriately, so if a person only care about Life posts, that person can check the &quot;Life&quot; tag for all relevant posts.</p>
<p>Please allow me to explain each tag.</p>
<h4>Life</h4>

<p>The Life tag will be stories from my life.  I follow Jesus as Lord, and I love discussing what that looks like.  Many Life posts will be theological.
I also enjoy funny stories and would like to share entertaining experiences as they come.  <strong>I hope to allow people to walk through my life and
give glory to God through my thoughts, encouragements, and stories</strong>.</p>
<h4>Tech</h4>

<p>If you read much of Tank Studios Tech Talk, you will know what this involves.  In Tech, I will primarily be discussing interesting technology as I find it.
<strong>If a technology is useful in my life, I am sure it will be useful in somebody else&#39;s life</strong>.  I want to share that information in order to benefit you.</p>
<h4>Dev</h4>

<p>I expect this one to really only benefit software developers who stumble upon my site via Google.  In these I will be speaking of software development.
<strong>I may post about a problem I have solved or about a personal project I am working on</strong>.  Occasionally I have solved problems and thought, &quot;I could write a blog post about that.&quot;
If I have that thought, now I can!</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There&#39;s the explanation for the new blog and the new site!  Please leave any feedback in a comment below!  Are there any topics you would like me to cover in the future?</p>
