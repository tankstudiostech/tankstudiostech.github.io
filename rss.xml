            <title><![CDATA[Jesus in the OT - Jesus the Snake]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
    We would never compare Jesus to a snake.  Why would we? The snake is forever remembered as the enemy - the tempter who led Eve to take the first bite of the forbidden fruit.
    Jesus is the offspring in Genesis 3 who crushes the head of the snake! <strong>Whoever makes that comparison must be crazy...</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>But that would mean Jesus is crazy.</strong>  John 3:16 is perhaps the most well-known verse: &quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son,
    that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.&quot;  But notice, the first word in that sentence is &quot;For.&quot;
    The word &quot;for&quot; means something preceded that statement.  So let&#39;s take a step back:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        No one has ascended into heaven except He who descended from Heaven, the Son of Man.  And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must
        the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life. - John 3:13-15.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    See, Jesus compares Himself to a serpent!  In memory of <a style="color: cornflowerblue;" title="The Offensive Gospel" href="/posts/snake-attack.html">my near death by snake</a>, this section of JOT (Jesus in the Old Testament) will
    explain why Jesus calls Himself a snake.  You can read the intro to the JOT series <a style="color: cornflowerblue;" title="JOT Intro" href="/posts/jot-intro.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>The Grumbling Israelites</h3>

<p>
    <strong>Let&#39;s first step back from Jesus&#39; time.</strong>  A big step...all the way back to Moses.  Moses is leading the nation of Israel around in circles in the wilderness.
    Moses got them to the Promised Land, but the nation freaked out because the people were giant!  Not trusting God, they went back into the wilderness; having
    just escaped slavery in Egypt, there was nowhere for them to go.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>These people have seen God do incredible things time and time again.</strong>  They follow a giant pillar of dust by day and fire by night! Bread falls from the sky,
    water comes from a rock, the ground has opened under men, and so much more.  Yet once again, the Israelites complain about God to Moses: &quot;Why have you brought us up out of Egypt
    to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food!&quot; (Num. 21:5)
</p>

<p>
    They are like the entire human race.  Our very existence relies on God&#39;s will (Rev 4:11).  We see and hear of His acts, but we rebel. We hate Him,
    we ignore Him, and we mock Him. We use the name of our Creator as a curse!  <strong>We, like the Israelites here,
    declare that all the good He does is evil.</strong>  In this world, treason against your nation is considered a terrible crime, but <strong>we have been
    committing treason against The Divine from the beginning.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    God, being just, declares the sentence for their crime: &quot;Then the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died.&quot;
    However, immediately following, the people come to Moses saying &quot;We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and you.  Pray to the Lord, that He take
    away the serpents for us.&quot; And Moses prays, and the Lord, as merciful as He is just, provides a way for them to be healed: &quot;Make a fiery serpent and set it on
    a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.&quot;  <strong>Moses obeys, and the people who look at the serpent on the pole live.</strong> (Num. 21:6-9)
</p>

<h3>Jesus the Serpent</h3>

<p>
    Now lets return to John 3:14-16.  In this passage, Jesus is talking to a man named Nicodemus. Nicodemus wanted to speak to Jesus because he believed it was
    clear that Jesus came from God.  They then get into a discussion about entering the Kingdom of Heaven, during which
    Jesus explains, &quot;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him
    may have eternal life.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    Nicodemus is a Pharisee - a member of the religious elite.  He knows the book of Numbers better than anyone else.  The full story of the Israelites
    would have flashed through Nicodemus&#39; head when Jesus spoke of the serpent in the wilderness.
    Now that we have the information Nicodemus had, let&#39;s look at what Jesus was saying.<br></p>

<p>
    The people of Israel had rebelled against God, declaring the good He does as bad.
    We, likewise, do the same every day.  This evil deserves punishment. We have earned the cup of God&#39;s wrath on the Day of Judgment.
    We have already committed this crime.  <strong>No good we do now can cover our sin, just as a murderer cannot clear his name by being good the rest of his life.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>But God, being merciful, provided a way to be free of this judgment.</strong>  First we must recognize our sin against God, as the Israelites did.  We must believe that
    we are rebels, completely deserving our punishment and completely hopeless to avert it.  <strong>God graciously provides a Substitute, the snake, Jesus, and sets Him on a pole, the cross.
    And if we look to the snake on the pole, Jesus on the cross, we will be saved!</strong>  The venom in us, the sin in us, means certain, eternal death (Rom. 6:23). We are dead men walking. But
    when we look upon the snake, Jesus on the cross, we will be brought back to life!
</p>

<p>
    The snake - the lying, deceitful snake that led us away from God in the beginning - is our father.  Jesus tells the general Jewish populace, &quot;You are of your father the devil, and your
    will is to do your father&#39;s desire.&quot;  Jesus saves us by becoming the snake as well.  <strong>While on the cross, all the acts of rebellion we commit against God are placed upon Jesus!</strong>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        [Jesus] was pierced for our transgressions; He was crushed for our iniquities; upon Him was the chastisement
        that brought us peace, and with His wounds...we are healed.  We all like sheep have gone astray; we have turned - every one - to his own way; and the Lord
        has laid on Him the iniquity of us all (Is. 53:5-6).
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
    Wow...just wow.  If that does not leave you in speechless awe of our Lord and Savior, I do not know what will.  Just as God raised up a snake on a pole when the Israelites
    sinned in the time of Moses, the Son of Man must be lifted up on the cross, so that any who believe will be saved from their sin and have eternal life.  For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son,
    the Son who knew no sin but became sin, became the snake, for us all, so that whoever believes in Him will have eternal life, becoming the righteousness of God in Him (Jn. 3:14-15, 2 Cor. 5:21).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>John 3:16 grows in depth and power when we see how the OT created the same picture hundreds of years before.</strong>  I hope this post has grown your love of
    John 3:16, the OT, and most importantly, Jesus.  If you have never looked to the snake on the pole, please do!  The venom is sliding through your body, leaving
    you a dead man walking, and you will be sentenced to death on the Day of Judgment.  Our only hope is letting Jesus endure the punishment for us.

            <title><![CDATA[The Day a Snake Tried to Kill Me]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
    Recently I went to Utah with my church.  The trip went really well.  We met people
    who love Jesus deeply, we had great conversations with people who did not, and we grew in our love and faith in Christ.
    This post, however, does not contain those stories; <strong>it contains the story of when I nearly got
    attacked by a snake.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Hiking</h3>

<p>
    It starts as all great horror stories do:
    <strong>A group of unsuspecting friends decide to go on an adventure away from the modern world.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    The group and I discover a hiking trail. The trail goes through the mountains of Utah and ends at a
    beautiful waterfall cascading down the walls of a canyon.  The hike will be tiring, but we are confident it is
    worth the work.
</p>

<p>
    For a while, we travel up the edge of the mountains.  <strong>The area is not the most attractive,
    but the view of the city is</strong>.  We occasionally stop for photo shoots when we find a great
    backdrop...or when my friend Sean finds a natural chair.
</p>

<p>
    <img class="small-image" src="/img/snake-attack/naturalchair.jpg" alt="Natural Chair">
    <center><small>All pictures in this post were taken by Jordan Permaul. Thanks for letting me use them Jordan!</small></center>
</p>

<p>
    Then, we hike deeper into the mountains.  The scenery changes from desert-like terrain to
    forest-like terrain.  Trees are all around us.</p>
</p>

<p>
    <img class="small-image" src="/img/snake-attack/quiettime.jpg" alt="Bible in Forest">
</p>

<p>
    There are two constants on our hike.  <strong>The first
    constant is the stream bubbling beside us.</strong>  We assume it is flowing from the waterfall.
    My pastor Caleb declares the water clean (because all flowing water is clean!) and he, Sean, my
    other friend Jordan, and I take a drink.  It&#39;s delicious!
    My wife Michelle and Sean&#39;s wife, Erica, refrain from drinking.  &quot;What if somebody upstream just
    relieved himself in the stream?&quot;, they asked.
</p>

<p>
    ...Good point.  Too late now!
</p>

<p></p>
    The second constant is the upward slope of the climb. Who knew climbing a mountain was
    going to be so tough! <strong>Where we previously were stopping for
    photo shoots, we now are constantly stopping for breaks.</strong>  Gravity is now our biggest enemy.
</p></p>
<p>
    After an hour of sweat, tears, and a few drinks of beautiful, clean, and possibly urinated in 
    stream water, <strong>we arrive at the top.  And it is worth it. Take that gravity!</strong>
</p>

<h3>The Waterfall</h3>

<p>
    The waterfall is unlike any waterfall I have seen before.  At first that sounds impressive,
    but I&#39;ve only seen about five other waterfalls.  <strong>Unlike the picturesque waterfalls one
    might see in photographs, this water was simply rolling down the rocks.</strong> 
</p>

<p>
    <img class="small-image" src="/img/snake-attack/waterfall.jpg" alt="Waterfall">
</p>

<p>
    It was beautiful in its own way.  We all enjoy staring at it for a while.  Then, the guys all lay against the rocks, getting drenched in the
    frigid water.  We relax for a while, enjoying the view and recovering from the long hike. <strong>Finally,
    we decide to head back to the bottom.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <img class="small-image" src="/img/snake-attack/inwaterfall.jpg" alt="In the Waterfall">
</p>

<h3>The Snake</h3>

<p>
    Going down is much less tiring than going up.  Gravity seems to have a change of heart and becomes
    our ally rather than enemy.  About halfway through the forest area, Sean and 
    I see boulders jutting off the mountain in the distance.  <strong>I determine
    that standing on those boulders would grant a fantastic view, and I plan to climb on top of them.  Sean
    offers to join.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    We tell the others to go on, but Jordan decides to stay with me and Sean.
    The boulders, surrounded by many smaller rocks and bushes, are uphill from our
    starting point.  I conclude that if I scramble quickly up the mountain, the movement
    of the rocks underfoot will affect me less compared to taking it slow.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>I take off, scrambling up the mountainside hand and foot.</strong>  I use some brush to pull myself
    higher, when suddenly I hear Sean yell!  I quickly reach a stable spot and turn
    to see what happened.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Sean, to my horror, declares he heard a hissing sound just before seing an orange and black snake come
    after me!</strong> The bushes and rocks are suddenly much less friendly.  In my mind, every shadow
    becomes a den of snakes!  Sean saw the snake go under a rock, and so he carefully begins looking
    for it.  He does not find the orange and black snake.  Instead, he finds something worse...
</p>

<p>
    <strong>He finds a different snake. He claims this snake is as big as his arm!</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>I am now trapped up this steep hill covered in bushes.</strong>  The route I just took has at least two
    snakes hidden.  Other paths downward do not look promising.  There is no safe way to head back.<br>    I look up at the boulders to which I was heading, examine all the rocks and shrubs 
    that make great snake hiding holds, and know I cannot
    continue on. At this moment, I must face a sad fact:
</p>

<p>
    <strong>I am going to die.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    But, gathering inspiration from that poem Michael Caine quotes a few too many times in <em>Interstellar</em>,
    I decide not to go gentle into that good night!  <strong>I begin a mad sprint down the hill.</strong>  Gravity,
    revealing its sinister plan, attempts to force me off balance as I desperately keep my body upright.
    Locked tight in this battle of balance, snakes all around, knowing a fall could result in a broken
    body or a venom-filled bloodstream, I yell, &quot;Father God please protect me!&quot;
</p>

<p>
    <strong>And at last, I arrive safely back on the trail.</strong>  The downhill sprint seemed to last a few minutes
    despite being only a matter of seconds.  I return to meet Sean and Jordan, and they show me
    the snake.
</p>

<p>
    <img class="small-image" src="/img/snake-attack/snake.jpg" alt="Snake!">
</p>

<p>
    We catch up to Michelle, Erica, and Caleb, and we tell them the story.  It takes them a bit of
    convincing, but they all finally believe when we show them the picture.
</p>

<p>
    Safe and sound, once again enjoying the beauty of the hike in the mountains, we finish the trip
    and return to our home.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="small-image" src="/img/snake-attack/mountainview.jpg" alt="Walking">
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
    Thank you God for keeping me alive!  Maybe I was in less danger than I thought I was,
    <strong>but it definitley seemed like I could have died that day.</strong>
    But you know, I also could have died in high school when, stepping off the curb without
    looking, I was one step away from a head-on collision with a semi truck. In fact, I could die today, 
    or I could die tomorrow. There are snakes and mountains and car accidents and 
    diseases and mysterious sudden endings, and we never see any of them coming.<br></p>

<p>
    <strong>Being 25, I am beginning to grasp the shortness of life.</strong>  I am learning that I am
    not invincible, and even if I have 50 years ahead of me, the years will disappear so rapidly.<br>    James asks us, &quot;What is your life?&quot;  And then answers: Our life is but a vapor.<br>    We do not know what tomorrow will bring! (James 4:14).
</p>

<p>
    But facing the shortness of life, I have learned two things: first, <strong>I do not need to fear death because death is only the beginning.</strong>
    I am a stranger to this world (1 Peter 2:11), my citizenship is in Heaven (Phil 3:20), and death will only bring me home.
    But if you do not follow Jesus as Lord, death is the end of all joy and happiness.
    Sin separates you from Him because God, being just,
    sentences us to an eternal punishment.  But Christ became sin for us, took God&#39;s wrath upon Himself on the
    cross, and allows us to live in right standing before God.  <strong>Please seek out the truth of this.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Second, <strong>we have work to do in life.</strong>  Living comfortably and easy in a coma of entertainment
    will completely waste our life here.  Paul says that, if Jesus wasn&#39;t resurrected,
    we would be free to &quot;eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die&quot; (1 Cor. 15:32).  But because
    Jesus was resurrected, we must live a life using our time and resources to point people to Him.
    <strong>That is the only work that really lives on into eternity.  It is the only work that leads to
    a life not wasted.</strong>
</p>

<p>
     I hope you enjoyed the story!  Have you
    had any near-death experiences?  <strong>I would love to hear
    your story, or any other feedback, in the comments below or on Facebook.</strong><br></p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Syncing and Securing Accounts with Last Pass]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
    We always hear that our accounts are not secure because of bad passwords.  However, even using the same, memorable password for every account I make,
    I still have a hard time remembering how to log in to my accounts.
</p>
<h3>Last Pass to the Rescue</h3>
<img src="/img/tech/lastpass/lastpass-icon.png" />
<p>
    Last Pass is a password manager.  It stores any username/password combination you have for any given site inside its secure &quot;vault&quot;.
    To enter the vault, it requires one master password.  Once this password is entered, it will auto-fill any request for a username and
    password. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>This allows you to have many different passwords.</strong>  You only have to remember one master password, your &quot;last pass&quot;, and the
    rest will be filled out by the vault.  Last Pass also has a password generator, so you don&#39;t even have to come up with the password!  <strong>Anytime
    you are creating a new account, Last Pass will offer to generate your password and save the site.  The next time you go to log in
    to the site, Last Pass will fill it out for you.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This 1-minute video explains it very well.
</p>

<div class="fluid-width-video-wrapper" style="padding-top: 56.3333333333333%;">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RM0fzHxMASQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p><h3>Password Syncing is Awesome</h3></p>
<p>
    Password syncing is my favorite feature of Last Pass. The Last Pass vault
    is available through a browser extension, website, and app.  This is better than using a web browser&#39;s built in password functionality; if you
    save a password on your computer&#39;s browser, you can only load the saved information from that computer!  Your phone&#39;s browser will not haved the password saved!
    <strong>But if you sign in to your Last Pass vault, you can access any account credentials on any computer.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Even better, you can have multiple accounts saved for one site.  Previously, when I needed to log in to my
    wife&#39;s Gmail or Spotify account, or if she wanted to log in to our bank account, we would have to ask each other for the credentials.
    <strong>With Last Pass, we can both easily log in to any account one of us has created!</strong>
</p>

<p><h3>Is Password Security Important?</h3></p>
<p>
    I have never been hacked;  therefore, I have always had a hard time caring enough about securing passwords.  I&#39;ll never get hacked!...<strong>But,
    what if I did? What could happen?</strong>  Well, my money could be
    transferred to a different bank or PayPal account.  My Facebook account could be used to say horrible things to friends.  My email could be used as a
    spambot.  I could keep going.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>But what is worse, if an attacker gets one account, and you use the same email and password for everything...the attacker has all your accounts!</strong>
    After getting into one account, they can go to all the major banks, credit card companies, social media sites, and email sites, trying
    that email/password combination. They would get into any of the sites you have an account for!
</p>
<p>
    In fact, <a href="http://xkcd.com/792/">this xkcd comic</a> illustrates how some attackers set up websites for that very purpose!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>So yes, password security is important.</strong>
</p>

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3></p>
<p>
    I hope this post has at least made you consider securing your accounts.  Last Pass is a great option.  I highly recommend looking into it.
    However, there are many other great tools that accomplish the same goal.  <strong>If you use the same password for every site, take the time to
    look into a password manager and start securing your accounts.</strong>  It took me little effort, and I have already paid off the time through
    the password syncing!
</p>
<p>
    What do you think?  Do you want to start using Last Pass, or do you already use a different one?  Feel free to tell me about it below!  Also,
    if you have any more in-depth questions about Last Pass, ask away. I am happy to answer as best I can.

            <title><![CDATA[Jesus in the Old Testament - Introduction]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
    The Old Testament (OT) is an interesting set of books.  I can safely assume most Christians have not read the OT entirely, and
    I can definitely assume most Christians know and understand the New Testament (NT) better than the OT. I am among the latter group.
    And finally, some Christians likely only find benefit from it by it adds weight to the hardcover book, gaining arm strength lugging it around.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>However, there is amazing depth in the OT when it is read understanding its purpose.  I hope to explain that purpose, and in each further post in this series, explain
    an OT story, showing how that story meets the purpose.</strong>
</p>

<p><h3>What is the OT?</h3></p>
<p>
    Before delving into the purpose, let us briefly discuss what the OT is.  <strong>The OT is a series of books outlining the history of the Jewish nation and God&#39;s interactions with them.</strong>
    There are several different series that were written in similar ways with a similar mindset.  The series are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Books of the Law</strong> - Tells the story of creation, shows God choosing the Israelites, details them reaching the land He promises them (modern day Israel), and lists out
    the laws God gives them to follow, such as the Ten Commandments.</li>
    <li><strong>Books of History</strong> - Tells the story of the Israelites taking over the Promised Land and their ups and downs in following the laws of God up to around 400 B.C.</li>
    <li><strong>Books of Wisdom</strong> - Explains life proverbs, discusses the meaning of life, and contains prayers and songs of individuals to God.</li>
    <li><strong>Major Prophets</strong> -  Contains the words of God spoken through men to Israel, rebuking, foretelling judgement, and promising restoration after repentance.</li>
    <li><strong>Minor Prophets</strong> - Contains the same as above, but in (typically) shorter books.</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>What did the Jewish Nation Believe of the OT?</h3></p>
<p>
    Knowing what the OT contains, lets talk about why it was written.  <strong>Paul says that all Scripture is God-breathed and useful (1 Tim. 3:16-17).</strong>
    In Jesus&#39; time, the Jews held the OT in high esteem.  They strictly followed the laws and sacrifices
    listed in the books of the Law.  They sang the Psalms and searched out the meanings of the prophets.  <strong>They believed their salvation into eternal life
    rested within the scriptures.</strong>
</p>

<p><h3>Jesus&#39; Explanation of OT&#39;s Purpose</h3></p>
<p>
    And they were correct!  But many did not understand how the OT led to eternal life.    <strong>Jesus Himself calls them out, explaing
    that they have completely missed the OT&#39;s purpose.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    In John 5, the Pharisees -- the Jew&#39;s religious leaders -- ask Jesus who testifies with Him that
    He is the Christ.  Jesus tells them that John the Baptist testifies (Jn 1:29), His works testify (...all 4 gospels), and finally that the entire OT testifies:
</p>

<p><div></p>
<p><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
    You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life...
    Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father.  There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope.  For if you believed Moses, you would believe
    Me; for He wrote of me. (Jn 5:38-46)

    The Pharisees knew entire OT in and out, but when Jesus came, they rejected Him!  <strong>Jesus tells them that if they truly believed what they were reading,
    they would not be rejecting Jesus; they would be worshipping Him!</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>So we see, the OT does point to eternal life because in its entirety -- every single letter -- it points to Jesus.</strong>  It details how we fall short of the glory of God,
    fail in our role as His image bearers, and desperately need a Savior.  It explains that from our failures we have earned the wrath of God, and that just
    as a murderer has to pay the penalty for breaking the law, we also must pay the penalty for rebelling against our Creator.  And finally, it points to the One
    who will come to save us; He will come, bear the wrath of God in our place, give us the chance to have His right standing before God, and reign as Lord over all.
    For a fuller picture of this, please read <a style="color: cornflowerblue;" title="The Offensive Gospel" href="/posts/offensive-gospel.html">this explanation
    of the Gospel from Romans 5</a>.
</p>

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3></p>
<p>
    I hope this post has excited you to see all the ways the OT points to Jesus.  <strong>Understanding this concept has deepened my love for the OT, and it always excites me
    when I find in it another picture of what Christ has done for us.</strong>  God always comes up with the best symbolism and parables.

            <title><![CDATA[The Gospel is Offensive]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
    Recently I told a <a style="color: cornflowerblue;" title="The Day My Car Panicked" href="/posts/broken-car.html">story about my car getting fixed</a>.  During that time, I shared the gospel with the mechanic.
    The mechanic told me he has no interest in following Jesus.  He does not even believe Jesus
    walked the Earth!  <strong>However, he explained that he enjoys hearing messages from a well-known preacher.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    His explanation confused me.  <strong>What about the gospel could a person
    who completely rejects the Godhood and Lordship of Christ enjoy?</strong>  The only explanation is that pastor
    must have not preached the gospel.
</p>

<p><h3>The Offenses</h3></p>
<p>
    Paul claims that in sharing the knowledge of Christ, &quot;we are the aroma of Christ in God both to those who are being saved
    and those who are perishing. To one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life.&quot; 2 Cor. 2:16.
    <strong>When we explain the gospel of Christ, we share the gospel in love, but people will not always love the gospel.</strong>
    Please join me in Romans 5:6-11 as I explain why.
</p>

<p><h4>We Exist because God Allows It</h4></p>
<p>
    &quot;For while we were still weak, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.&quot; Rom. 5:6.
</p>
<p>
    We want to be independent, but the gospel explains that we are weak.
    <strong>In fact, Rev 4:11 says we would stop existing if Jesus stopped wanting us to exist.</strong>
    Jesus could also stop our heart from beating or stop giving us air to breath.
    The gospel offends our pride in our independency.
</p>
<h4>We have Rebelled</h4>
<p>
    &quot;God shows His love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; Rom 5:8.
</p>
<p>
    We want to be blameless, but the gospel explains that we have broken God&#39;s law.
    <strong>We are &quot;by nature children of wrath&quot; (Eph 2:3). There is no one good, not even one (Ps. 14:3).</strong>
    The gospel offends our self-righteousness.
</p>
<h4>We will be Condemned</h4>
<p>
    &quot;Since therefore we have been justified by His blood, much more shall we be saved by Him from
    the wrath of God.&quot; Rom. 5:9.
</p>
<p>
    We want to be free of responsibility, but the gospel explains that
    we will be condemned for our rebellion against our Creator.  Murdering only once
    brands us as a murderer, deserving punishment.  Breaking God&#39;s law (sinning) only once brands us a sinner, and
    we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Rom 3:23).  God is just, vengeance is His, He will repay (Deut 32:35).
    <strong>Justice will be served, evil will be destroyed, and God accomplishes this at judgement, condemning
    sinners to an eternity in hell.</strong>
    The gospel offends our desire to be free of responsibility for our evil.
</p>
<h4>We Cannot Save Ourselves</h4>
<p>
    &quot;For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more, now that
    we are reconciled, shall we be saved by His life.&quot; Rom 5:10.
</p>

<p>
    We want to be good enough on our own, but the gospel explains, as stated earlier, that
    we have all sinned and will have God&#39;s wrath poured out on us. We can do
    nothing to prevent that.  But Jesus did!  While we were DEAD in our sins, we were saved by grace
    through faith in Jesus Christ, not by works so that none may boast (Eph 2:8).  Praise Jesus for doing
    what none of us could do!  He lived a perfect life, and
    God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf so that in Him
    we might become the righteousness of God (2 Cor 5:21)!  <strong>By believing in Jesus we are legally made
    not guilty in the sight of God!</strong>
    The gospel offends our confidence in ourselves.
</p>
<h4>We Must Follow Jesus as Lord</h4>
<p>
    &quot;More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received
    reconciliation.&quot; Rom 5:11.
</p>

<p>
    We do not want to submit to anyone; we want to live a life where we simply eat, drink, and be merry (1 Cor 15:32), but the
    gospel explains that Jesus, being God in flesh
    (1 Tim. 3:16), demands our obedience.  Truly believing in Him requires us to accept Him as Lord of our life.
    We are made a new creation (2 Cor 5:17), our sin is crucified with Him on the cross, we are buried with Him in death, and we
    are risen to walk with Him in His resurrection to life (Rom 6:4).  <strong>Living lives our own way shows we have no love
    for Him and that we have never been justified and made new.</strong>  The gospel offends our authority over ourselves.
</p>

<p><h3>Conclusion - Jesus is Life</h3></p>
<p>
    I hope you see how this message is offensive to those who do not believe.  <strong>If there is no love for Jesus,
    nobody can find any of the above to be the &quot;good news&quot; believers know it to be.  When we as believers
    preach the gospel, we must preach it this way. Any other message will not save.</strong>  The gospel is the power
    of God for salvation to those who believe (Rom 1:16), but if someone comes with a different gospel,
    they will be accursed (Gal 1:8).
</p>

<p>
    If you do not follow Jesus as Lord, <strong>I BEG you on behalf of Jesus Christ, be reconciled to God!</strong>
    God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on YOUR behalf so that in Jesus you might become the
    righteousness of God (2 Cor 5:20-21).  Please believe.  Jesus came that we may have life and life in
    abundance (Jn 10:10).  He is the best master to have.  Go to Him, for He gives rest,
    His yoke is easy, and His burden is light (Matt 11:28-30).
</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Day My Car Panicked]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h3>Car Problems</h3>
<p><strong>The Tankersley family seems to be cursed with car troubles.</strong>  to the extent a man wanted to write a book 
about our many difficulties. Discovering my car has another 
problem is like waking up to a shiny, new pimple on my face.  It is common enough to not be
surprising, but I wish I could just make it go away for good.</p>

<p><strong>Recently, a metaphorical pimple manifested in a most inconvenient way.</strong></p>

<h3>Locked Door</h3>
<p><strong>My car door lock had been finicky.  It was refusing to accept my key as the proper key.</strong>  I always managed to unlock the car, but
eventually I took it into a Honda dealer.  They fixed it...for a week.  But it once again began to be finicky.</p>

<p>I decided to stop locking my front car door.  I would every other door, just not the front.  My car helped me accomplish this plan
in that the automatic lock would lock all but the front door.</p>

<p><strong>Or so I thought...</strong></p>

<p>Pulling up to my office, I get out of the car and close the door.  Remembering I need to lock all but the
front door, I open the door again, hit the lock button, and let gravity close the door for me.</p>

<p>As it shuts, I suddenly realize that my car has betrayed me; <strong>it locked all 4 doors!</strong>  I attempt
to stick my fingers in the door before gravity finishes the dirty deed, but I am left only with a jammed finger
and the bitter taste of defeat.<p>

<p>I decide to deal with it later, but as I walk towards my office, I realize my phone is still in the car.
Not sure how long I have until phone withdrawal kicks in, I turn around and spend the next fifteen minutes,
key in the door, twisting, jamming, and begging.  <strong>Finally, I head into my office with no success.</strong></p>

<p>My wife is kind enough to pick me up at the end of the day.  We try her key to no avail.  I plan to try
again the next day.  If I cannot get the key into the door, I will call a person to pop the lock open for
me and then bring the car back to the dealership.</p>

<h3>Pop-A-Lock</h3>

<p><strong>At lunch the next day, I head to my car in prayer.</strong>  &quot;Father, it would be wonderful if You opened this door
for me.  I know You can.  It would save me $50 and the headache of having people come out
to open it.  So why not?  This is my attempt, and then I will call roadside service.
I trust Your plan and will.&quot;</p>

<p>Expecting a miracle, I continue jiggling the key, again to no avail.  <strong>Dejected, I call the Pop-A-Lock guy.</strong>
He comes and pops the lock open in roughly 30 seconds, completely shaking my confidence
that my locked car is actually safe.  <strong>I then open the door...and the car enters panic mode</strong>.</p>

<p>The security alarm honks constantly if the car is not unlocked properly, which I had no way to do!
The horn dies down after about 5 minutes, but
reopening a door or starting the ignition causes it to flare up all over again.  We set the alarm off
three times trying to solve the problem.  I am now the favorite person of all the businesses in the area.</p>

<p>The Pop-A-Lock man gives up, but he tells me he will wave the $45 fee of opening the door and
send a new guy out to replace my entire lock!  Thanking him, I turn to go inside...until I once again realize
my phone is still in the car.  I prepare myself for the hatred of all around me, open the door, grab my phone,
and walk away as my car repeatedly cries out its panicked alarm.<p>

<h3>The Repair</h3>
<p>A few hours later, a man comes to repair the door.  As he is repairing the door, we chat for about an hour.
<strong>In that time, I get to tell him about following Jesus, and I invite him to my church!</strong></p> 

<p>Once he fixes the lock, I ask about getting a remote key for keyless entry.  I learn I can at no extra cost!
For $130, a man comes to pop my lock, then another comes to replace my lock, and finally they make a third
trip to give me a remote entry key!  A dealership would price that around $300. <strong>If God had answered
my request to have the door opened, I would have paid way more money, I would have been without
a car for a few days, and I wouldn&#39;t have gotten to share the gospel.</strong>  I&#39;m glad God followed His plan rather
than answering my request in the way I asked.</p>

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3></p>
<p> In Philippians, Paul tells us to be anxious for nothing, but instead make our requests to God, and 
His peace that surpasses all understanding will guard our hearts.  Sometimes we see God work things out in an awesome way.
Sometimes we are left wondering why God didn&#39;t answer our request
the way we expected Him to answer.</p>

<p><strong>Paul doesn&#39;t tell us God will answer how we want.</strong>  Paul simply explains
we can have peace knowing that God has heard our request and will work all things together for good to
those who love Him and are called according to His purpose.  <strong>Obediently trusting Him with our requests will
give us peace and lead us closer to Jesus, and Jesus is worth more than time, money, and any
other created thing.</strong></p>

<p>So today, determine what is making you anxious, make your request to God, and trust that He
will work it out in a way that leads the most people to His Son.  <strong>If knowing Jesus more isn&#39;t an
appealing result, please seek to understand how Christians can say, &quot;I count all things as rubbish compared
to the joy of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed the story!  I look forward to any feedback, questions, or stories that you have to give!

            <title><![CDATA[Managing Your Life Projects and To-Do Lists with Trello]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Most of us have so many tasks to do we lose track of them all. We may make lists, but we often need the list when we don&#39;t have it, or we simply let it fall out of date.
<strong>Trello provides a free, easy way to create and manage tasks from wherever you are</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/trello/trello.PNG" alt="Trello Logo"></p>

<p>I have been using Trello for half a year now and have found it to be beneficial to practical life management.  Here is how.</p>

<h3>Trello: The Answer to Task Management Woes</h3>

<p><a title="Trello" href="http://www.trello.com/">Trello</a> allows you to manage tasks in a simple, stylish, and effective way. 
<strong>Trello can revolutionize your task lists in three ways: categorizing, detailing, and syncing</strong>.</p>

<p><h3>Categorizing</h3></p>
<p>On a paper task list, there are typically two categories: to-do and done.  Trello allows three levels of categorization.</p>

<p><h4>Boards</h4></p>
<p>First, similar tasks are categorized into Boards.  Boards are the highest level.  One board may contian all the tasks for the house.  Another board may contain all the tasks for the office.
<strong>Boards give clear distinctions between contexts</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/trello/trelloboards.PNG" alt="Trello Boards"></p>

<p><h4>Lists</h4></p>
<p><strong>Second, tasks within the context of a board, are grouped into lists</strong>.  These lists allow you to further organize tasks.  Want to be able to measure the progress of a task?  Then perhaps
you would organize your boards into progress lists, &quot;Not Started&quot;, &quot;In Progress&quot;, &quot;Almost There&quot;, and &quot;Done&quot;.  Would you rather, instead
further narrow down the context of your boards?  Your lists could then be, &quot;Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Garage&quot;, &quot;Living Room&quot;, and &quot;Bathroom&quot;.</p>

<p><img src="/img/trello/list.PNG" alt="Trello Lists"></p>

<p>But what if you want to measure both progress and context?  Labels solve that problem.</p>

<p><h4>Labels</h4></p>
<p>Finally, tasks can be attached with labels.  <strong>Tasks can have as many labels attached as
desired</strong>.  So, a red label could mean &quot;Not Started&quot;, a yellow label could mean &quot;In progress&quot;, and
a green label could mean &quot;done&quot;.</p>

<p><img src="/img/trello/listwithlabels.PNG" alt="List With Labels"></p>

<p>Alternatively, a red label could mean &quot;Kitchen&quot;, yellow &quot;Garage&quot;, green &quot;Living Room&quot;, and blue &quot;Bathroom&quot;.</p>

<p>All these categories can be used in whatever way you want!  Nearly all of my boards are categorized differently to suit my needs.</p>

<p><h3>Detailing</h3></p>
<p>With traditional pen and paper tasklists, there is not much room for details.  With too many details, the paper will get cluttered, and it will no longer be simple and succinct.
<strong>With Trello, you can get a clean tasklist when you only want an overview, but you then can get detailed tasks on further examination</strong>.</p>

<p>When looking at a Trello board, you can see details about a task at a glance.  You can see the list it
is on, the labels it has attached,
the due date you have set, and the people the task is assigned to.  These details are all added
elegantly so they only draw your eye when you are looking for them.</p>

<p><img src="/img/trello/complexlist.PNG" alt="Complex List"></p>

<p>When you click a task, you get the opportunity to see and add even more details!  Inside the task editor, tasks can receive checklists, images, comments, and a variety of other details.</p>

<p><h3>Syncing</h3></p>
<p>If you own a smartphone, your tasks are always on-hand.  Trello is a web-based application with apps on all smartphones.  <strong>Using Trello, 
you no longer have to carry a tasklist around with you</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, if there is a group of people you want working with you on the taskboard, members can be added to the board.  <strong>If one person changes a task, all members of the board immediately get the changes</strong>!</p>

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3></p>
<p>Trello has been a huge help to my wife and I in managing house and life projects.  <strong>What do you think?  Worth trying out, or do you already have a method you are happy with?</strong></p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Plastic for Dinner]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><h3>Bad Planning</h3></p>
<p><strong>I am not a chef</strong>.  I belive good chefs are artists. <strong>Good chefs know how to improvise.  I do not.</strong></p>

<p>My lovely wife does most of the cooking.  Everything she makes is delicious.  She has the ability to improvise.</p>

<p>This day, she was not arriving at the house until 6:15, and we had somewhere to be at 7:00, <strong>meaning it is my turn to cook.</strong>
I have roughly 7 meals I can make edible.  My planned dish for the evening: honey salsa chicken.</p>

<p><img class="small-image" src="/img/plastic-for-dinner/stove.jpg" alt="Open Stove"></p>

<p>I arrive home at 5:45 and begin preparing the ingredients.  With the ingredients prepared, I read the directions.
The final step: bake for one hour.</p>

<p><h3>Improvisation</h3></p>
<p>Dinner would be <em>ready</em> at 7:00.  <strong>Baking for an hour wouldn&#39;t
even give me time to finish it, much less eat it!</strong></p>

<p>Remember said inability to improvise?  I pull everything I have out of my improvisation skill
bucket and come up with a brilliant idea!</p>

<p>I call my wife.</p>

<p>...voicemail: &quot;Hi, this is Michelle Tankersley.&quot;</p>

<p>Having already used all my improvisation for the day, I am trapped with my idea.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Call</strong>: &quot;Hi, this is Michelle Tankersley.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Call</strong>: &quot;Hi, this is Michelle Tankersley.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Call</strong>: &quot;Hi, this is Michelle Tankersley.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Call</strong>: &quot;Hi, this is Michelle Tankersley.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>After five back-to-back calls, I decide she must not be picking up.  However, being determined to provide my wife with honey salsa chicken, 
I drink the dregs of my remaining improvisation, and, <strong>for the first time in my cooking history, I develop a plan!</strong></p>
<p><h3>Spilling the Nachos</h3>
&quot;I can cook it in a skillet!&quot;  Using a skillet on a stove top is much faster than baking, and it would get the job done!</p>
<p><img class="small-image" src="/img/plastic-for-dinner/stovetop.jpg" alt="Stovetop"></p>

<p>Being pleased with the idea, I rush to begin.  My enthusiasm quickly fades when I see the pan of leftover nachos from the night before, enjoying its place on our best working stove top.
<strong>As I pick it up to pour the crumbs into the trash, my phone rings.</strong></p>
<p>In a desire to get to the phone before I missed the call, <strong>I quickly scrape off the nachos...all over the floor.</strong>  &quot;No time!&quot; I think, throwing the nacho pan into the sink.
Before sprinting into the living room, I turn on the burner to let it warm.  I race to the living room, grab the phone, move my thumb to answer...and the ringing ends.</p>
<p>Seconds away.  Love it when that happens.</p>
<p><h3>Plastic Fumes</h3>
The call was from Michelle.  I call her back and this time she answers.  We have a chat about my idea, and she agrees I should continue with the plan.  Again excited
to create my delicious chicken, <strong>I return to the kitchen, only to find my cat, Tessie, enjoying a second dinner consisting of nacho crumbs.</strong>
Shooing her away, I get the broom out of the closet, toss the dust pan to the side, and begin furiously sweeping up the crumbs.</p>
<p>Finished, I look around for the dustpan.  My eyes land on it.  <strong>When tossing the dustpan to the side, it managed to settle right on top of the burner!</strong></p>
<p>Immediately pulling the dustpan off, I discover a nice hole burned through it, leaving behind a puddle of melted plastic still cooking on the burner.  Still, the dustpan works well enough to sweep up the nacho crumbs.</p>
<p><img class="small-image" src="/img/plastic-for-dinner/dustpan.jpg" alt="Burnt Dustpan"></p>

<p>The burning plastic is filling the air above the stove with smoke.  The air smelled just like cancer.  Delicious.</p>
<p><h3>Enjoying the Meal</h3>
I scrape the plastic off the burner with a grill cleaner and begin cooking the chicken.  Michelle returns home, and she is thankfully forgiving of my attempt to destroy everything we own.
<strong>The chicken finishes, we enjoy a nice, home-cooked meal, and we arrive at our destination at 7:05.  Victory!</strong></p>
<p><h3>Conclusion</h3>
We can&#39;t all be good cooks, and we don&#39;t all get to enjoy the smell of burning plastic, but we all know the sweet feeling of victory after countless defeats.
I thank God for reminding me of Phillipians 2:14 in the middle of this experience: &quot;Do all things without grumbling and arguing&quot;. Holding His Word in front of me, I stayed humored rather than annoyed.
I hope He continues working in me so that when life gets much messier than spilled nachos and burnt dust pans, <strong>I will find joy in knowing Jesus
as Savior and Lord, joy in what He did on the cross, and all trials will be nothing in the light of His saving grace.  That is &quot;life, and life in abundance.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed my story!  Any feedback or similar moments that you have to share?  Leave a comment!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[First Post!]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody!  Thank you for coming to Tank Studios Blog.  My name is Ryan Tankersley 
and I&#39;ll be the author of these posts.  Feel free to check out the <a title="About Page" href="blog.tankstudios.net/about.html">About Page</a> to see what I&#39;m all about.</p>
<h3>Wait, Haven&#39;t You Done This Before?</h3>

<p>...Yeah.  The first one, Tank Studios Tech Talk, was a primer to see if I enjoyed blogging.  <strong>I did, but I felt limited</strong>. 
First, the blog never felt like mine.  I&#39;m a software developer.  I wanted the site to be mine in the sense that I knew the code.  Blogger gave me 
a nice, pre-packaged template that I liked, but again, it never felt like mine.  I made this website using <a title="DocPad" href="http://www.docpad.org/">DocPad</a>.
DocPad makes creating websites with Html, JavaScript, and CSS much easier than simply starting from scratch, and I can change anything on this site
that I want to.</p>
<p>Secondly, I desired a broader scope than just Tech Talk.  <strong>Here I will be discussing three core subjects: Life, Tech, and Dev</strong>.
Each subject will be tagged appropriately, so if a person only care about Life posts, that person can check the &quot;Life&quot; tag for all relevant posts.</p>
<p>Please allow me to explain each tag.</p>
<h4>Life</h4>

<p>The Life tag will be stories from my life.  I follow Jesus as Lord, and I love discussing what that looks like.  Many Life posts will be theological.
I also enjoy funny stories and would like to share entertaining experiences as they come.  <strong>I hope to allow people to walk through my life and
give glory to God through my thoughts, encouragements, and stories</strong>.</p>
<h4>Tech</h4>

<p>If you read much of Tank Studios Tech Talk, you will know what this involves.  In Tech, I will primarily be discussing interesting technology as I find it.
<strong>If a technology is useful in my life, I am sure it will be useful in somebody else&#39;s life</strong>.  I want to share that information in order to benefit you.</p>
<h4>Dev</h4>

<p>I expect this one to really only benefit software developers who stumble upon my site via Google.  In these I will be speaking of software development.
<strong>I may post about a problem I have solved or about a personal project I am working on</strong>.  Occasionally I have solved problems and thought, &quot;I could write a blog post about that.&quot;
If I have that thought, now I can!</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There&#39;s the explanation for the new blog and the new site!  Please leave any feedback in a comment below!  Are there any topics you would like me to cover in the future?</p>
