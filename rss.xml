            <title><![CDATA[My Biggest Regret]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
    Everybody makes mistakes.  The bigger they are, the more painful
    the memory. Many people live with a motto such as
    &quot;no regrets&quot; or simply recognize that mistakes create the person
    that exists today and hope that&#39;s a good thing.
</p>

<p>
    I agree with those concepts. However, I do regret a few actions.  I&#39;m thankful for the person I became, by the
    grace bought by Jesus Christ, learning through those actions. But I still wish
    that I had already been the kind of person that did not make those mistakes to
    begin with.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Here is the story that I regret the most.</strong>
</p>

<p><h3>The Valediction</h3></p>
<p>
    When I was in middle school, I went to a high school graduation. Afterward, I asked
    my dad why some students got to speak. He explained that the valedictorians, those
    who made a 4.0 GPA, deliver a farewell speech at the graduation.
</p>
<p>
    &quot;I&#39;m going to be a valedictorian.&quot; I then decided. And I succeeded.
</p>
<p>
    Years later, I began preparing for the speech. I thought and thought over what message
    I wanted to share. At the time, <strong>I was not a follower of Christ.
    Therefore, God got a shoutout at the beginning of my speech and that was it.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I was pleased with the final product.  <strong>The speech explained the importance of goals
    in a persons life. When a person makes goals, they have direction.  Without goals,
    we wander aimlessly in life, never accomplishing anything.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    My final line and conclusion, &quot;A life without goals - a life without purpose - is no
    life at all.&quot;
</p>
<h3>The Response</h3>
<p>
    Everybody loved it. Some teachers said it was the best valediction they had ever heard. 
    Everyone I knew approved of my message.
</p>
<p>
    The message I shared was the message by which I lived. I went to college with many
    goals and plans for my life. Graduate, get an awesome job, marry, have kids, enjoy!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>...And my first year of college was miserable.</strong> By the middle of the second semester
    I was looking towards all these goals I set and asking, &quot;What&#39;s the point? I&#39;ve set
    all these goals for my life, but do they really bring meaning?  I&#39;m just going to
    die, right?  Who cares if I get rich or get married? And will I <em>really</em> enjoy
    doing the same job for 40 years?  Is giving up that much of my life for money really
    having a life?&quot;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>It was starting to sound like the life I had chosen, and the life I preached at my
    valediction, was &quot;no life at all&quot; as well.</strong>
</p>
<h3>The Life</h3>
<p>
    <strong>These thoughts finally led to my knees before my
    Lord,</strong> declaring that I am a terrible God, that He is worthy of all honor and glory,
    that I have been rebelling against Him and rejecting Him my whole life, that I
    deserve punishment, and that I need Him to save me from the just judgment that
    I deserve.
</p>
<p>
    And He did save me. <strong>I died to my sins with Him on the cross, canceling the record of debt
    that stood against me (Col 2:12-15), and it is no longer I who live, but
    Christ who lives in me, and the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith
    in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me! (Gal 2:20)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I have found true Life in the past 7 years.  Goals do not bring life. Money
    does not bring life. Entertainment doesn&#39;t, people don&#39;t, sin doesn&#39;t.  <strong>They
    all bring only death. But Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life (John 14:6)
    and He has come the we may have life, and life in abundance! (John 10:10)</strong>
</p>
<h3>The Regret</h3>
<p>
    My biggest regret is that speech. I stood before a captive audience of more than a thousand
    people, hanging on to my every word, seeking to hear the advice that I would
    give as they go out into the world. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>There, I offered them life...a life full of toiling after goals they create based
    on their own desires, and a life that would be found wanting in the end, bearing
    no eternal significance.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>If I could have it back, I would spend the time pointing them back
    to the true bringer of life, Jesus Christ</strong>, begging them on behalf of Christ,
    be reconciled to God, for He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf,
    so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. (2 Cor 5:20-21)
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    So there it is: my biggest regret. I hope any who took my advice
    to heart ended up walking the same road I did, leading straight into
    Christ. 
</p>
<p>
    I know that one day I will give an account to God for all I have done:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        For the word of God is living and active,
        sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul
        and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts
        and intentions of the heart. Nothing in all creation is hidden from God&#39;s sight.
        Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give
        account.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    <strong>Hebrews 4:13-14</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>But thankfully, as stated above, Christ has made me innocent. I am
    free from my guilt</strong>, and instead can say with Paul:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what
        lies ahead, I press on toward the goal
        for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    <strong>Philippians 3:13-14</strong>
</p>

<p>
    As always, I love to hear anybody&#39;s feedback, comments, or questions!

            <title><![CDATA[Riding a Horse with the Blessed Sovereign]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
    I rode a horse two weeks ago.  It was only my second time to ride
    without a guide holding  the reigns.
</p>

<p>
    The first time riding, I had little confidence in my ability, and the horse was in command.<br>    This plan did not work out in my benefit.  The horse walked between two trees that were very close together.
    The trees were far enough apart for the horse to squeeze through, but they were too close to let my legs get past!
    <strong>Not being willing to control the horse, I let him walk
    me straight into the trees!</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Thankfully, I did not get pushed from his back.  Instead,
    I managed to put the horse in reverse and get out of the trees.  Afterwards, I kept a firmer hand on the reigns.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>My second outing went better.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Part One: The Crying Girl and the Mountain Climbing Horses</h3>

<p>
    Michelle and I are the last to get in the saddle.  <strong>I&#39;m riding Bill and Michelle is on Daisy.</strong>
    As we get comfortable, our fearless leader, a 12 year old girl, gives
    us instructions on controlling the horse.
</p>

<p><img class="small-image" src="../img/horse-riding/horse-stand.jpg" /></p>
<center class="img-caption"><small>Michelle by her horse Daisy</small></center>

<p>
    The scene is what one would expect on a group horse ride: a gorgeous day at
    perfect temperature, a leader giving instructions, a few dogs circling the group,
    11 people atop horses in a semi-circle, each hanging on to every word in hopes it might save their life, 
    <strong>and one 16 year old, sobbing, clearly convinced the instructions will
    not save her from her impending doom.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    I try to act as if the crying girl does not exist, realizing her
    three friends can comfort her much better than I. If I were in
    her shoes, I also would prefer others to ignore my existence. <strong>As
    the ride begins, it is clear that neither her friends nor
    my valiant efforts at ignorance will cheer her.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    The girl and her boyfriend end up right in front of me.  He is
    speaking soft words to her from his horse.  <strong>His horse, however,
    did not get the memo of kindness. Apparently the two horses
    get close to each other, and I watch as the boyfriend&#39;s horse
    kicks the girl&#39;s horse!</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Thinking back on it, perhaps the horse did get the memo, and it is just not skilled at
    awkward social interactions.  <strong>In any case.
    I am thrust into an awkward social interaction myself.</strong>
    The girl falls behind me, but her boyfriend and two other
    friends are stuck in front of me due to the narrow trail.  The result:
    constant stares and regular words of encouragement
    passing by me to the crying girl. <strong>Caught previously
    ignoring the girl&#39;s existence, I am now offered
    the same treatment.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Eventually the girl begins to cheer up.  In fact, she even smiles! <strong>However, the trail,
    expecting unskilled horseman to just be gaining confidence, decides to
    throw us a deep incline.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    The horses are now wondering why we are expecting them to behave like
    mountain goats.  They turn sideways, inching step by step downhill.  I hear
    the girl stifle a cry behind me. We soon discover that the horses are experts in
    mountain climbing!  They head down the hill at a steady pace without incident.
</p>

<h3>Part 2: The Beauty of Nature and Cowdogs</h3>
<p>
    As we traverse this steep hill, I realize how much I am loving this experience! The horses are
    carrying full grown people on their back down a hill I probably couldn&#39;t
    safely traverse on my legs, and they are pros! The ride is full of excitement.  <strong>And as
    we break free of the mountain and into more open fields, the horses begin to trot.
    Even the girl can&#39;t hold back laughter as we move through the plain, enjoying
    the sun.</strong>
</p>

<img class="small-image" src="../img/horse-riding/ryan-horse.jpg" />
<center class="img-caption"><small>Ryan riding Bill</small></center>

<p>
    The rest of the trip we are treated to grand views.  The ranch is in Broken Bow, and the owner&#39;s
    property is beautiful. <strong>Being cooped up in cities for so long now, it&#39;s easy to forget
    what it&#39;s like to be surrounded by nature!</strong>
</p>

<img class="small-image" src="../img/horse-riding/mountains.jpg" />
<center class="img-caption"><small>The view of the mountains</small></center>

<img class="small-image" src="../img/horse-riding/michelle-horse.jpg" />
<center class="img-caption"><small>Michelle on her horse</small></center>

<p>
    <strong>In this area, the dogs following become comedians.</strong>  They run between our horse&#39;s legs, chasing each other. When we
    reach the water, one dog is so small he swims through what the horses are easily walking in.
    As he reaches the end, he attempts to jump up on a dry rock, misses by a bit, and tumbles back into the water!
    He immediately gets up and finds another route.
</p>

<p>
    Then we get to see the dogs at their funniest moment.  We pass a herd of cattle, and the dogs decide
    to chase them down!  Do you remember the scene in The Lion King where Pumbaa barrels into
    a crowd of vultures?  <strong>This is similar, except it&#39;s like Timon chasing a crowd of Pumbaas!</strong>
</p>

<p>
    The cows run full speed away from the dogs, but one cow can&#39;t get away from a certain dog!  The dog chases
    right on the heels of the cow.  The dog is clearly having the time of its life!  The cow on the other hand...
</p>

<p>
    After a complete hour, we arrive safely back at the starting location.  <strong>We all had a great time, including the
    previously terrified girl!</strong>
</p>

<h3>Conclusion: Our Blessed God</h3>

<p>
    Recently, I memorized 1 Timothy 6:15.  It begins with &quot;He is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of
    Kings and the Lord of Lords.&quot; As we were trotting along in silence, I decided to spend some time
    meditating on that verse, specifically what it means that God is &quot;blessed.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    Working with the understanding that &quot;blessed&quot; is roughly synonymous to the word &quot;happy,&quot; I considered the 
    happiness of God.  The atmosphere was very timely.  Because God is omnipresent (Psalms 33:13-14),
    He was with us during that ride. I considered how pleasing the trip must have been to Him.  He created all
    nature: the sun, the trees, and the horses. And He gave us dominion over them and wants us to enjoy 
    (Psalm 8:6-7).  <strong>The eleven of us were marveling at His creation that day.</strong>  We were laughing in glee
    when the horses picked up the pace or the dogs were acting silly.  We cried in terror at the power
    of the horses.  <strong>And those of us who believe in Him and call on His name were praising Him for the works of
    His hands.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    I am confident watching people enjoy His creation blesses Him as an artist is pleased when others
    enjoy his painting. <strong>In fact, I am confident that God is constantly happy.</strong> His plan of saving
    the nations through Jesus is in motion, in His name, by His power, and with Him with us,
    His followers war against darkness.  And because of His grace, a broken world gets time to
    marvel at the beauty of what He creates.
</p>

<p>
    Any time you look in awe at creation, remember the Creator.  <strong>As the painter puts his personality into the work,
    God has put Himself into the world.</strong> Romans 1:20  states that His eternal power and divine nature are clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world!
    Whenever you are enjoying creation - admiring the stars, riding a horse, enjoying your friends - you are enjoying the Creator of them all.
</p>
<p>
    I&#39;d like to leave you with a Psalm.  I&#39;d love to hear stories of your favorite times enjoying
    God in nature!  Feel free to leave me any comments or feedback!
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        O Lord, our Lord,
            how majestic is your name in all the earth!
        You have set your glory above the heavens.
            Out of the mouth of babes and infants,
        you have established strength because of your foes,
            to still the enemy and the avenger.
    </p>
    <p>

        When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,
            the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,
        what is man that you are mindful of him,
            and the son of man that you care for him?
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings
            and crowned him with glory and honor.
        You have given him dominion over the works of your hands;
            you have put all things under his feet,
        all sheep and oxen,
            and also the beasts of the field,
        the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,
            whatever passes along the paths of the seas.
    </p>

    <p>
        O Lord, our Lord,
            how majestic is your name in all the earth!
    </p>
    <p>
        Psalm 8 (ESV)
    </p>

    See you next time!

            <title><![CDATA[Revitalizing My Prayers: Guided by Scripture]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
    In prayer, I often find my mind wandering. I can start praying about something I care deeply about, but within a minute,
    I&#39;ve wandered to video games. I also find my prayers to be shallow: &quot;Please do this,&quot; &quot;Thank You for that,&quot;
    &quot;Help me with this.&quot; Are any of those prayers bad? No. <strong>However, I want to talk to and about God that
    expresses a depth of love and emotion toward Him.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I want to praise God well. For example, a love letter would not look like this:
    &quot;Dear wife, you are awesome. Thank you for everything you do. I hope to treat you well. You are also pretty. Love, husband.&quot;
    While the letter is founded on a deep love of the wife, there is no depth in what the letter says.
    All the words are true, but love letters should express emotion!  The more like Shakespeare, the better!
</p>
<p>
    In the same way, I want to outwardly express the love and joy I have for God. John 3 explains that He already knows the mind and
    hearts of men, but even though He knows, I want to tell Him!  And, I want others to know as well. I love to tell others
    about how great my wife, Michelle, is. Even more so I love to tell others how great my Lord and Savior, Jesus, is!
    And when I tell people, I don&#39;t want my language to be simple and fluffy; I want to speak in a way that they
    feel the emotion with me!
</p>

<p>
    I believe that ability starts with learning to pray.
    Thankfully, I have recently found a way to combat the shallowness of my prayers: the scripture.
</p>

<h3>A Helpful Solution</h3>

<p>
    I read an article on <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org">Desiring God</a> titled <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/reignite-your-prayer-life"><em>Reignite your Prayer Life</em></a>. This part of the
    article resonated with me:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        And what is the method of prayer for most Christians? It’s this: When we pray, we tend to say the same old things about the same old things. Sooner or later, that kind of prayer is boring. When prayer is boring, you don’t feel like praying. And when you don’t feel like praying, you don’t pray — at least with any fervency or consistency. Prayer feels much more like duty than delight.
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem is not that we pray about the same old things. To pray about the same things most of the time is normal.
        That’s because our lives tend to consist of the same things from one day to the next. Thankfully, dramatic changes in our
        lives usually don’t occur very often.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>No, the problem isn’t that we pray about the same old things; the problem is that we tend to say the same old things about
        the same old things. The result is that we can be talking to the most fascinating Person in the universe about the
        most important things in our lives — and be bored to death.</strong>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    The author, Don Whitney, proposes a solution for the problem. He recommends praying the Bible. <strong>And, rather than
    praying the words exactly as written and leaving it there, we instead are to let scripture take us by the hand, guiding our
    prayers into its own depths.</strong>
</p>

<h3>How to Start Praying the Bible</h3>

<p>
    With this method, I have come to love the Psalms. Previously I would struggle to focus and enjoy them. What changed?
    <strong>I learned to pray with the Psalmist rather than just read his prayers.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Many, if not most, Psalms are prayers. They express every emotion in life: joy, sorrow, doubt, apathy, anger, fear, etc.</strong>  Reading
    the Psalms we find a profoundness in thought, understanding, and speech. The Psalmists have a way of speaking to God about their
    life I cannot match. 
</p>

<p>
    Dietrich Bonhoeffer explains the reason to pray the Psalms. The Bible, including the Psalms, is divinely inspired. This means
    each sentence contains the words of God written by the hands of men. <strong>With the Psalms, a book of prayers, God gave us a 
    divinely inspired book full of prayers to Himself!</strong>  The Psalms are essentially God-approved prayers. We have some specific
    examples from Jesus, especially the Lord&#39;s prayer, but then we have 150 more found in the Psalms!<br></p>

<p>
    <strong>It is easy to join with the Psalmists in prayer.</strong> Lets start with Psalm 37:4 - &quot;Oh taste and see that the Lord is good!&quot; We could respond, 
    &quot;Yes Father, my life clearly portrays your goodness. You took me when I was sad, lonely, and frightened, 
    freed me from my slavery to sin, and made me confident in You. Thank you for my salvation!
    Thank you for the way you show me your goodness in the people you have placed around me.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
    Continuing from v5 - &quot;Oh fear the Lord, you his saints, for those who fear him have no lack!&quot; We could respond, &quot;Increase my fear of you, Lord. 
    I depend on you for every need. You could take away all physical or mental abilities - even my life! - in an instant if you desired. 
    They all come from you. And even if my life takes a turn for the worse, and I lose everything, you will provide for my every need,
    just as you provided your Son to pay the penalty of death I earned for my rebellion. Please show your steadfast love to my friend
    who is struggling. Teach him to fear you as well, showing us both how in you we &#39;lack no good thing.&#39; &quot;
</p>

<p>
    It&#39;s as simple as that. As we follow along with the Psalm, we will be led to pray over areas of our life we
    might have completely forgotten otherwise. <strong>I am weak in the art of praising what I adore, so I have become
    an apprentice to the Psalmists, seeking their guidance.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Every book in the Bible can inspire prayer. Some places are easier than others,
    but we can always respond to the word of God in thankfulness or
    request, realigning our desires with His will.
</p>

<h3>Extra Benefits</h3>

<p>
    Praying the word not only deepens our communication with God, it deepens our understanding and love of His Word. <strong>As we spend time
    praying the scripture back to God, we are meditating on it and personalizing it.</strong>  We will not just read through the Bible, letting
    each verse fly over our head, but instead we are taking the time to let the word dig into our hearts and mind, pushing us to
    respond to God in what we say to him and what we do in our lives.
</p>

<p>
    To quote Don Whitney one more time:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        By this method, your prayers will be guided and shaped by Scripture, and be far more in conformity to the word and will of God than they will if you always make up your own prayers.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
    As a disclaimer, praying the Bible is not a magic bullet to all our prayer needs, nor is it a requirement for
    every Christian. <strong>First and foremost we must learn how to be intimate with Christ.</strong>  We have to learn to devote time
    spent with Him, refreshing and nourishing our souls. <strong>Learning to have focused, intimate time with Christ is as important to
    our spiritual self as eating is to our physical.</strong>  What we do during that time, however, is not important as long as it
    is grounded in truth, which comes from the Bible. &quot;Sanctify them by the truth; Your word is truth.&quot; John 17:17.
</p>

<p>
    However, I definitely encourage you to give it a try yourself! <strong>For a trial run, take out time
    for the next few days to pray through a favorite Psalm each day, choosing a new one each time.</strong> If you don&#39;t have a favorite, 
    try out Psalm 1, 23, 34, 42, and 141. Simply read through the Psalm once to get a understanding of the text as a whole, then
    read a verse or phrase at a time, praying whatever comes to mind. If your mind wanders, go to the next verse or phrase!
</p>

<p>
    Have you ever done this method?  If not, do you think it could be helpful to you?  I would love to hear your thoughts on it
    as well as any other methods that may help people revitalize their prayer life!

            <title><![CDATA[Godliness is not a Means but an End]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
    <p>
        [He is] imagining that godliness is a means of gain. But godliness 
        with contentment is great gain, for we brought nothing into the world, 
        and we cannot take anything out of the world. - 1 Tim 6:5-7
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    When previously I heard and read that verse, I
    never understood it.  When I considered the meaning, I would
    try to figure out what godliness gains.  Godliness gains much!
    For example, living a godly life brings joy in knowing we are pleasing the
    One we were made to please.  <strong>However, thinking just on that question
    misses the context of the passage.</strong>
</p>

<h3>An End, not a Means</h3>

<p>
    Looking before verse 6, we see Paul describing false teachers.
    These teachers use half-truths based on the gospel to sway
    the church members into following. This gains the teachers
    money, popularity, and power.  They avoid the
    <a href="offensive-gospel.html">offensive
    teachings of the gospel</a> and overexaggerate what people want to hear.
</p>

<p>
    If your gospel says, &quot;Follow Jesus, and you will have everything the
    world wants but keeps failing to get: money, power, success, health&quot;,
    take some time to consider your gospel; it&#39;s not the gospel
    Jesus brought.  The world is broken. <strong>Jesus
    did not come so that we could look like what the world glorifies.</strong> But
    we become the weak to shame the strong, the foolish to shame the wise, and those
    who are not to bring to nothing those that are (1 Cor 1:26-30).
</p>

<p>
    Paul here is saying that godliness is not a means to an end.  These false
    teachers are &quot;leading&quot; people to their own version of godliness, and this
    version glorifies the creation rather than the Creator.  <strong>The godliness
    that the people pursue is just a means to get some gain.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Paul corrects that thought.  Godliness is not a <em>means</em> of gain;
    godliness, with contentment, <em>is</em> great gain!  <strong>We should not be pursuing
    godliness so we can find our own personal gain, we should be pursuing 
    godliness as the gain.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Therefore trying to determine what gain godliness brings is completely
    missing the point.  Godliness <em>is</em> the great gain.
</p>

<h3>A Mindset Change</h3>

<p>
    Godliness, put simply, is the way our life pleases God. Paul says
    &quot;This is my aim, whether at home or away, to be pleasing to Him&quot; (2 Cor 5:10).
    We are made a new creation by faith in Jesus, and those who follow Him are
    loved and are made righteous, no longer to receive eternal wrath for disobedience.
    The love of God is unconditional and forever.
    But a parent can have unconditional love for a child
    and still at times receive great joy from the child and at others receive
    great grief.  <strong>Godliness is a lifestyle that brings our Father great
    joy.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    So how does living with the mindset of godliness
    being the end, being the great gain, affect my life?  It simplifies
    it!  We can look at everything as a means to the end of godliness.
    <strong>If godliness is truly our end, our great gain,
    we simply ask a question over every aspect of our life:
    &quot;Will this lead to godliness?&quot;</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Does my job lead to godliness?  How can I use this money to gain
    godliness?  I love my wife; how can I encourage her to gain godliness?
    My friend and I are going to hang out; what can I do or discuss
    in order to help us both gain godliness?  There is a stranger over there;
    can I do anything for him so that he can gain godliness?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>When seeing godliness as great gain, our time with Jesus becomes
    precious.</strong>  Time spent worshipping our Savior - reading
    and meditating on His Words, praying to Him, singing praise, etc -
    transforms us by the renewing of our mind to know
    the will of God: that which is good and acceptable and perfect 
    (Rom. 12:1-2).  That is godliness!  <strong>We go to Jesus, the only
    one who can satisfy our souls, to get godliness, the only end
    that is truly gain.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
    I hope you see the beauty in pursuing godliness as an end rather than
    a means. <strong>Pursue with me and encourage others to pursue also.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Also, I would like to thank Sean Fuentes for a great Bible study that
    started this thought process and Clinton Fields for a helpful
    insights on it later.
</p>

<p>
    I&#39;d love to hear how you pursue godliness along with any other comments!

            <title><![CDATA[The Tech Reformation Podcast]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
    Recently a few friends and I started up a podcast!  We have eight episodes currently
    released, and we are releasing a new episode every week!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is the podcast about? Where can you listen? How did we create it?</strong>
    If you are curious to know the answer to any of those, read on!
</p>

<h3>What is the Podcast About?</h3>

<p>
    The podcast is called <em>Tech Reformation</em>, with the tagline &quot;Where the world of technology meets the
    worldview of Christianity.&quot;  Four guys who love and follow Jesus and enjoy technology get together
    each week to merge the two together. 
</p>
<p>
    Technology is a huge part of our world today.  People are spending more time with electronics than
    ever before, new technologies are coming out every day, and many use them without thinking.
    We decided to think! <strong>We take the time to examine anything to do with technology,
    exploring the world&#39;s view and discussing the Christian&#39;s view.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Also, anything that is a huge part of the culture is going to have a
    huge impact on our Kingdom work.</strong>  Some technology is built specifically for ministry,
    some technology is built for secular purposes but can be used for ministry, and some
    technology should be avoided altogether.  <strong>We look for ways we can best use technology
    for the glory of God.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In the first segment, <strong><em>Tech You Should Know</em></strong>, we explore the week&#39;s technology news.
    Next up comes <strong><em>Tech You Should Use</em></strong> where we recommend a useful technology
    for your daily life. Finally, in <strong><em>Theology From the Headlines</em></strong>, we discuss current hot topics through the lens of
    a Christian worldview.
</p> 
<p>
    Currently we have discussed
    <ul>
        <li>Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality</li>
        <li>Automating Jobs</li>
        <li>Smartphone Usage</li>
        <li>Drones</li>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Free Internet</li>
        <li>Ad Blockers</li>
        <li>Internet Mob Justice</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Where Can I Listen?</h3>

<p>
    Interested in listening? <strong>The best place to start is our website at <a href="http://www.techreformation.com/">techreformation.com</a>!</strong> We post
    every episode to the site along with show notes containing links to the articles we discuss.
</p>

<p>
    Also, you can download a podcast app to your mobile device (I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict">Podcast Addict</a> on Android)
    and search &quot;Tech Reformation.&quot;  We&#39;re the only podcast that appears!  <strong>Most podcast apps allow you
    to download episodes so you can listen to them without Wi-Fi.</strong>
</p>

<h3>How Did it Start?</h3>

<p>
    It all started when a good friend of mine, Ben Robin, asked if I had any interest to do a podcast
    about technology and theology.  <strong>I enjoy both subjects, so I say I would be interested.</strong>  Time goes on, and he
    gets married and moves to Tennessee.  I forget about the podcast.
</p>

<p>
    A couple of weeks after the move, Ben sets up a meeting with me on Google Hangouts.  I expect he just wants to
    catch up since we haven&#39;t talked since his wedding.  <strong>You can imagine my surprise, then, when I
    realize two other guys I don&#39;t know will be joining the call, and we will be discussing the
    creation of a podcast!</strong>
</p>

<p>
    We have our first meeting where we just get to know each other a bit.  The two others are named
    Craig and Derek.  <strong>One fact is immediately apparent; Craig and Derek have never met. The only
    connection between us all is Ben.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    We converse for an hour, and then Ben has to leave.  Out of curiousity, I then
    ask Craig and Derek how they know Ben.  <strong>I learn that Ben tweeted, &quot;Anybody want to
    host a podcast with me?&quot;, and they were interested to join!</strong>  So, other than a few internet
    messages, they didn&#39;t know Ben either!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Luckily, they are both awesome guys.</strong>  Over the next months, we slowly began preparing all the little
    details that need to be put into place, and on August 9th we released our first podcast!
</p>

<p>
    We have been recording every week since.  We have completed eight episodes and an introduction
    episode, and it has been a blast to create.  <strong>It&#39;s like hanging out with 3 friends to talk about
    Jesus for an hour, except we record it.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
    If you like technology and/or love Jesus, check us out! I think you will enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
    Any podcasts that you enjoy listening to yourself?  I&#39;d be interested in hearing about them!
</p>

<p>
    See you next time!

            <title><![CDATA[The Day My Car Stopped Moving]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h3>More Car Problems</h3>
<p>
    <strong>The Tankersley family seems to be cursed with car troubles.</strong>  If that line sounds familiar, 
    <a href="http://blog.tankstudios.net/posts/broken-car.html">this post</a> started the same a month and a half ago.
</p>

<p>
    My cars just enjoy dying.  I&#39;ve never owned a new car, but I&#39;m not sure that would help. 
    Nobody knows when this curse came upon the family.  Maybe my great-grandpa didn&#39;t carry
    an old lady up a hill, and now I need to go to a juvenile camp and carry her great-grandson.  Maybe
    it&#39;s just confirmation bias.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>In any case, my car died again.</strong>  Here&#39;s the story of all the chaos that ensued; enjoy the ride!
</p>

<h3>Error in Transmission</h3>
<p>
    Every Friday morning, my church has prayer at 7:00AM.  One may think that is unreasonably early; however,
    Michelle and I have been waking up between 5:45 and 6:00 to run around the neighborhood.
    You may wonder, what are they running from?  We&#39;re running from calories! <strong>The more
    calories I burn, the more ice cream I can eat!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Fridays are our short but hard days.  We run one mile as fast as we can!  This workout gives our legs diversity,
    but more importantly it gets us to prayer time on time.  After the run, we take our separate cars to the church.
    Roughly 2 minutes away, the excitement begins.  <strong>Speeding away from
    a stoplight going about 35 MPH, my car suddenly lurches!</strong>  Worriedly, I ask the car, &quot;Are you OK?&quot;  The car doesn&#39;t
    respond.  I continue to the church.
</p>
<p>
    Prayer time goes well, except when Sean notices that my front-passenger tire is flat.
    He always notices them flat; if he never looked at my car, the tires probably would never have issues.
    Maybe he&#39;s the one I need to carry up a hill...
</p>
<p>
    Planning to worry about the tire later, I head to work.  I get on the highway, but my car forcefully explains that
    getting on the highway is a terrible idea.  <strong>It does so by refusing to go above 35 MPH without revving up to
    5000 RPMs.</strong>  Not one to argue with my car, I immediately exit.  The car stays at 20 MPH...
    then 10...then stops moving.  It&#39;s acting like a stubborn dog that doesn&#39;t want to return home.  No matter
    how much gas I give it, it keeps its butt planted firmly on the ground.
</p>
<p>
    Working in an IT company, I&#39;ve learned the ultimate trick for fixing faulty hardware:  turn it
    off and back on.  Following this trick, my car decides it would love to drive more, and off we go!...
    at the crawling pace of 40MPH.  <strong>The poor thing just can&#39;t shift gears!</strong>  I decide to bring the car home rather than
    go straight to work, and, after one more incident of not being able to move, I make it home.
</p>

<h3>The Journey To Work</h3>
<p>
    I plan to just work at home for the day until I realize that, for the first time in two weeks, I
    left my computer at work.  Now I am at home with the perfect excuse to simply work at home for the day...and 
    I don&#39;t have my computer.  Being a software developer, a computer is pretty important.  <strong>Somehow I have
    to get to my office.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    So what do I do? <strong>I change into my running shoes and go for my second jog of the day!</strong> I have always believed that
    you never know when you are going to need the ability to run long distances.  Most days you don&#39;t. This day I do!
    My work is only 2 miles away from my house, and Michelle and I run that distance every day!
</p>
<p>
    We do not, however, run that distance in the heat.  It is now roughly 85 degrees outside.  We also typically
    shower before we are seen (or smelled) in public.  Running in the heat, in jeans, for 20 minutes,
    being a well-hydrated guy, I am definitely going to sweat.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Today, I sweat a lot.</strong>
</p>
<h3>The Day At Work</h3>
<p>
    I enter my office as wet as if I had swam in my clothing.  Reaching my desk, I 
    suddenly realize how well the A/C works in the building.  InterWorks definitely accommodates the
    Northerners!  Realizing it is in everybody&#39;s best interest for me to not leave a puddle everywhere
    I go, I head to the bathroom to towel off.
</p>
<p>
    Then, the day of awesomeness begins.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I walk into the kitchen and am met with breakfast food galore.</strong>  One person brought pastries from a bakery, one brought donuts from
    a donut shop, and one brought food from McDonalds.  Having just worked off a good number of calories, 
    I gave my body plenty of its most important nutrient: sugar.  Or high fructose corn syrup.
    <strong>Whatever it was, it was delicious.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    A short time later, I discover that InterWorks is bringing in lunch for the day!  Perfect timing, since I decided not to
    run with my lunch in hand.  <strong>I spend the lunch hour dining with friends on fluffy tacos.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    After lunch, I return to my office, exiting soon after upon hearing laughter in the hallway.  <strong>I uncover the source:
    my fellow coworkers are taking turns on a mini segue!</strong>
</p>

<img src="../img/immovable-car/erover.png" />

<p>
    I spend the next hour watching people riding and riding it myself.  These machines are awesome.  They appear
    impossible to use, but once you get the hang of it, they seem to follow your thoughts
    more than your feet.  <strong>They are brilliant little machines; try one out if you ever get the opportunity.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Finally, the day is over and Michelle picks me up.  I&#39;m definitely glad I left my computer at work.  <strong>I would have missed out
    on a great day otherwise!</strong>
</p>

<h3>The Cost</h3>

<p>
    Over the next week, Michelle and I attempt to get the car fixed.  First I bring it in to a Honda Dealer.  <strong>They want 
    to replace the transmission.</strong>  The cost: $5100 for used, $6300 for new.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>GULP</strong>
</p>

<p>
    I politely tell them my car is not worth that much, and I and retrieve it.  As I drive the car home, I wonder if this will be the last
    time I ever drive it.  Michelle and I attempt finding
    a better price.  After asking around, I find a shop that can do the repair for $3000.  <strong>We decide the price is good,
    and we bring the car in!</strong>
</p>

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3></p>
<p>
    <strong>The last time my car had issues, I shared how God often turns a bad situation into a good one.</strong><br>    Then, He took a situation that should have cost me $500 and made it nearly free, 
    <a href="http://blog.tankstudios.net/posts/offensive-gospel.html">then gave me the opportunity to share the gospel with the mechanic</a>!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>However, it does not always work out that way.</strong>  This instance is a prime example. I was left
    two weeks without a car and $3000 poorer. And what did I gain?  Well...at first glance, nothing.
</p>
<p>
    But what more do I need?  In Romans 8, Paul asks &quot;If God is for us, who can be against us?  He who did not spare His own
    Son but gave Him up for us all, how will He not also with Him graciously give us all things?&quot;  <strong>If God was willing
    to send Jesus as our replacement on the cross, what good is He going to withold?  He has already given us the
    greatest gift ever; there&#39;s nothing left to withhold!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    But how does that make sense in this case?  He withheld the good of a fixed car 
    that doesn&#39;t cost $3000, right?  <strong>Sure, if we consider
    a car and money as the most important!</strong>  But Paul says 
</p>

<blockquote>
    For Christ&#39;s sake I have suffered the loss of all things
    and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own
    that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith, that
    I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and may share in His sufferings, becoming like Him in His death, that by any
    means possible I may attain the ressurection from the dead. - Phil 3:8-10
</blockquote>

<p>
    <strong>The greatest gift that God ever gave is Jesus!  And the great gift that He continually gives us is Jesus.</strong>  The &quot;loss&quot; of my
    car and money really mean nothing to me.  Jesus will never leave me nor forsake me (Heb 13:8).  What can I 
    possibly lose?  And if somehow being without a car for two weeks and being out $3000 lets me know Him even more?  <strong>Then
    I count the car and money as rubbish.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Life won&#39;t be easy.  Above, Paul specifically says that to know Christ&#39;s resurrection we must share in His sufferings. Christ
    suffered far greater than we ever can, but we will have our own sufferings.  However, suffering never means God is withholding
    good, because God is never withholding the righteousness that comes from Jesus and the joy of knowing Him!
    <strong>If you are suffering, let it draw you deeper into your Savior.</strong>
</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Jesus in the OT - Jesus the Snake]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
    We would never compare Jesus to a snake.  Why would we? The snake is forever remembered as the enemy - the tempter who led Eve to take the first bite of the forbidden fruit.
    Jesus is the offspring in Genesis 3 who crushes the head of the snake! <strong>Whoever makes that comparison must be crazy...</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>But that would mean Jesus is crazy.</strong>  John 3:16 is perhaps the most well-known verse: &quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son,
    that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.&quot;  But notice, the first word in that sentence is &quot;For.&quot;
    The word &quot;for&quot; means something preceded that statement.  So let&#39;s take a step back:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        No one has ascended into heaven except He who descended from Heaven, the Son of Man.  And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must
        the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life. - John 3:13-15.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    See, Jesus compares Himself to a serpent!  In memory of <a style="color: cornflowerblue;" title="The Offensive Gospel" href="/posts/snake-attack.html">my near death by snake</a>, this section of JOT (Jesus in the Old Testament) will
    explain why Jesus calls Himself a snake.  You can read the intro to the JOT series <a style="color: cornflowerblue;" title="JOT Intro" href="/posts/jot-intro.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>The Grumbling Israelites</h3>

<p>
    <strong>Let&#39;s first step back from Jesus&#39; time.</strong>  A big step...all the way back to Moses.  Moses is leading the nation of Israel around in circles in the wilderness.
    Moses got them to the Promised Land, but the nation freaked out because the people were giant!  Not trusting God, they went back into the wilderness; having
    just escaped slavery in Egypt, there was nowhere for them to go.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>These people have seen God do incredible things time and time again.</strong>  They follow a giant pillar of dust by day and fire by night! Bread falls from the sky,
    water comes from a rock, the ground has opened under men, and so much more.  Yet once again, the Israelites complain about God to Moses: &quot;Why have you brought us up out of Egypt
    to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food!&quot; (Num. 21:5)
</p>

<p>
    They are like the entire human race.  Our very existence relies on God&#39;s will (Rev 4:11).  We see and hear of His acts, but we rebel. We hate Him,
    we ignore Him, and we mock Him. We use the name of our Creator as a curse!  <strong>We, like the Israelites here,
    declare that all the good He does is evil.</strong>  In this world, treason against your nation is considered a terrible crime, but <strong>we have been
    committing treason against The Divine from the beginning.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    God, being just, declares the sentence for their crime: &quot;Then the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died.&quot;
    However, immediately following, the people come to Moses saying &quot;We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and you.  Pray to the Lord, that He take
    away the serpents for us.&quot; And Moses prays, and the Lord, as merciful as He is just, provides a way for them to be healed: &quot;Make a fiery serpent and set it on
    a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.&quot;  <strong>Moses obeys, and the people who look at the serpent on the pole live.</strong> (Num. 21:6-9)
</p>

<h3>Jesus the Serpent</h3>

<p>
    Now lets return to John 3:14-16.  In this passage, Jesus is talking to a man named Nicodemus. Nicodemus wanted to speak to Jesus because he believed it was
    clear that Jesus came from God.  They then get into a discussion about entering the Kingdom of Heaven, during which
    Jesus explains, &quot;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him
    may have eternal life.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    Nicodemus is a Pharisee - a member of the religious elite.  He knows the book of Numbers better than anyone else.  The full story of the Israelites
    would have flashed through Nicodemus&#39; head when Jesus spoke of the serpent in the wilderness.
    Now that we have the information Nicodemus had, let&#39;s look at what Jesus was saying.<br></p>

<p>
    The people of Israel had rebelled against God, declaring the good He does as bad.
    We, likewise, do the same every day.  This evil deserves punishment. We have earned the cup of God&#39;s wrath on the Day of Judgment.
    We have already committed this crime.  <strong>No good we do now can cover our sin, just as a murderer cannot clear his name by being good the rest of his life.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>But God, being merciful, provided a way to be free of this judgment.</strong>  First we must recognize our sin against God, as the Israelites did.  We must believe that
    we are rebels, completely deserving our punishment and completely hopeless to avert it.  <strong>God graciously provides a Substitute, the snake, Jesus, and sets Him on a pole, the cross.
    And if we look to the snake on the pole, Jesus on the cross, we will be saved!</strong>  The venom in us, the sin in us, means certain, eternal death (Rom. 6:23). We are dead men walking. But
    when we look upon the snake, Jesus on the cross, we will be brought back to life!
</p>

<p>
    The snake - the lying, deceitful snake that led us away from God in the beginning - is our father.  Jesus tells the general Jewish populace, &quot;You are of your father the devil, and your
    will is to do your father&#39;s desire.&quot;  Jesus saves us by becoming the snake as well.  <strong>While on the cross, all the acts of rebellion we commit against God are placed upon Jesus!</strong>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        [Jesus] was pierced for our transgressions; He was crushed for our iniquities; upon Him was the chastisement
        that brought us peace, and with His wounds...we are healed.  We all like sheep have gone astray; we have turned - every one - to his own way; and the Lord
        has laid on Him the iniquity of us all (Is. 53:5-6).
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
    Wow...just wow.  If that does not leave you in speechless awe of our Lord and Savior, I do not know what will.  Just as God raised up a snake on a pole when the Israelites
    sinned in the time of Moses, the Son of Man must be lifted up on the cross, so that any who believe will be saved from their sin and have eternal life.  For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son,
    the Son who knew no sin but became sin, became the snake, for us all, so that whoever believes in Him will have eternal life, becoming the righteousness of God in Him (Jn. 3:14-15, 2 Cor. 5:21).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>John 3:16 grows in depth and power when we see how the OT created the same picture hundreds of years before.</strong>  I hope this post has grown your love of
    John 3:16, the OT, and most importantly, Jesus.  If you have never looked to the snake on the pole, please do!  The venom is sliding through your body, leaving
    you a dead man walking, and you will be sentenced to death on the Day of Judgment.  Our only hope is letting Jesus endure the punishment for us.

            <title><![CDATA[The Day a Snake Tried to Kill Me]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
    Recently I went to Utah with my church.  The trip went really well.  We met people
    who love Jesus deeply, we had great conversations with people who did not, and we grew in our love and faith in Christ.
    This post, however, does not contain those stories; <strong>it contains the story of when I nearly got
    attacked by a snake.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Hiking</h3>

<p>
    It starts as all great horror stories do:
    <strong>A group of unsuspecting friends decide to go on an adventure away from the modern world.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    The group and I discover a hiking trail. The trail goes through the mountains of Utah and ends at a
    beautiful waterfall cascading down the walls of a canyon.  The hike will be tiring, but we are confident it is
    worth the work.
</p>

<p>
    For a while, we travel up the edge of the mountains.  <strong>The area is not the most attractive,
    but the view of the city is</strong>.  We occasionally stop for photo shoots when we find a great
    backdrop...or when my friend Sean finds a natural chair.
</p>

<p>
    <img class="small-image" src="/img/snake-attack/naturalchair.jpg" alt="Natural Chair">
    <center><small>All pictures in this post were taken by Jordan Permaul. Thanks for letting me use them Jordan!</small></center>
</p>

<p>
    Then, we hike deeper into the mountains.  The scenery changes from desert-like terrain to
    forest-like terrain.  Trees are all around us.</p>
</p>

<p>
    <img class="small-image" src="/img/snake-attack/quiettime.jpg" alt="Bible in Forest">
</p>

<p>
    There are two constants on our hike.  <strong>The first
    constant is the stream bubbling beside us.</strong>  We assume it is flowing from the waterfall.
    My pastor Caleb declares the water clean (because all flowing water is clean!) and he, Sean, my
    other friend Jordan, and I take a drink.  It&#39;s delicious!
    My wife Michelle and Sean&#39;s wife, Erica, refrain from drinking.  &quot;What if somebody upstream just
    relieved himself in the stream?&quot;, they asked.
</p>

<p>
    ...Good point.  Too late now!
</p>

<p></p>
    The second constant is the upward slope of the climb. Who knew climbing a mountain was
    going to be so tough! <strong>Where we previously were stopping for
    photo shoots, we now are constantly stopping for breaks.</strong>  Gravity is now our biggest enemy.
</p></p>
<p>
    After an hour of sweat, tears, and a few drinks of beautiful, clean, and possibly urinated in 
    stream water, <strong>we arrive at the top.  And it is worth it. Take that gravity!</strong>
</p>

<h3>The Waterfall</h3>

<p>
    The waterfall is unlike any waterfall I have seen before.  At first that sounds impressive,
    but I&#39;ve only seen about five other waterfalls.  <strong>Unlike the picturesque waterfalls one
    might see in photographs, this water was simply rolling down the rocks.</strong> 
</p>

<p>
    <img class="small-image" src="/img/snake-attack/waterfall.jpg" alt="Waterfall">
</p>

<p>
    It was beautiful in its own way.  We all enjoy staring at it for a while.  Then, the guys all lay against the rocks, getting drenched in the
    frigid water.  We relax for a while, enjoying the view and recovering from the long hike. <strong>Finally,
    we decide to head back to the bottom.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <img class="small-image" src="/img/snake-attack/inwaterfall.jpg" alt="In the Waterfall">
</p>

<h3>The Snake</h3>

<p>
    Going down is much less tiring than going up.  Gravity seems to have a change of heart and becomes
    our ally rather than enemy.  About halfway through the forest area, Sean and 
    I see boulders jutting off the mountain in the distance.  <strong>I determine
    that standing on those boulders would grant a fantastic view, and I plan to climb on top of them.  Sean
    offers to join.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    We tell the others to go on, but Jordan decides to stay with me and Sean.
    The boulders, surrounded by many smaller rocks and bushes, are uphill from our
    starting point.  I conclude that if I scramble quickly up the mountain, the movement
    of the rocks underfoot will affect me less compared to taking it slow.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>I take off, scrambling up the mountainside hand and foot.</strong>  I use some brush to pull myself
    higher, when suddenly I hear Sean yell!  I quickly reach a stable spot and turn
    to see what happened.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Sean, to my horror, declares he heard a hissing sound just before seing an orange and black snake come
    after me!</strong> The bushes and rocks are suddenly much less friendly.  In my mind, every shadow
    becomes a den of snakes!  Sean saw the snake go under a rock, and so he carefully begins looking
    for it.  He does not find the orange and black snake.  Instead, he finds something worse...
</p>

<p>
    <strong>He finds a different snake. He claims this snake is as big as his arm!</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>I am now trapped up this steep hill covered in bushes.</strong>  The route I just took has at least two
    snakes hidden.  Other paths downward do not look promising.  There is no safe way to head back.<br>    I look up at the boulders to which I was heading, examine all the rocks and shrubs 
    that make great snake hiding holds, and know I cannot
    continue on. At this moment, I must face a sad fact:
</p>

<p>
    <strong>I am going to die.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    But, gathering inspiration from that poem Michael Caine quotes a few too many times in <em>Interstellar</em>,
    I decide not to go gentle into that good night!  <strong>I begin a mad sprint down the hill.</strong>  Gravity,
    revealing its sinister plan, attempts to force me off balance as I desperately keep my body upright.
    Locked tight in this battle of balance, snakes all around, knowing a fall could result in a broken
    body or a venom-filled bloodstream, I yell, &quot;Father God please protect me!&quot;
</p>

<p>
    <strong>And at last, I arrive safely back on the trail.</strong>  The downhill sprint seemed to last a few minutes
    despite being only a matter of seconds.  I return to meet Sean and Jordan, and they show me
    the snake.
</p>

<p>
    <img class="small-image" src="/img/snake-attack/snake.jpg" alt="Snake!">
</p>

<p>
    We catch up to Michelle, Erica, and Caleb, and we tell them the story.  It takes them a bit of
    convincing, but they all finally believe when we show them the picture.
</p>

<p>
    Safe and sound, once again enjoying the beauty of the hike in the mountains, we finish the trip
    and return to our home.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="small-image" src="/img/snake-attack/mountainview.jpg" alt="Walking">
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
    Thank you God for keeping me alive!  Maybe I was in less danger than I thought I was,
    <strong>but it definitley seemed like I could have died that day.</strong>
    But you know, I also could have died in high school when, stepping off the curb without
    looking, I was one step away from a head-on collision with a semi truck. In fact, I could die today, 
    or I could die tomorrow. There are snakes and mountains and car accidents and 
    diseases and mysterious sudden endings, and we never see any of them coming.<br></p>

<p>
    <strong>Being 25, I am beginning to grasp the shortness of life.</strong>  I am learning that I am
    not invincible, and even if I have 50 years ahead of me, the years will disappear so rapidly.<br>    James asks us, &quot;What is your life?&quot;  And then answers: Our life is but a vapor.<br>    We do not know what tomorrow will bring! (James 4:14).
</p>

<p>
    But facing the shortness of life, I have learned two things: first, <strong>I do not need to fear death because death is only the beginning.</strong>
    I am a stranger to this world (1 Peter 2:11), my citizenship is in Heaven (Phil 3:20), and death will only bring me home.
    But if you do not follow Jesus as Lord, death is the end of all joy and happiness.
    Sin separates you from Him because God, being just,
    sentences us to an eternal punishment.  But Christ became sin for us, took God&#39;s wrath upon Himself on the
    cross, and allows us to live in right standing before God.  <strong>Please seek out the truth of this.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Second, <strong>we have work to do in life.</strong>  Living comfortably and easy in a coma of entertainment
    will completely waste our life here.  Paul says that, if Jesus wasn&#39;t resurrected,
    we would be free to &quot;eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die&quot; (1 Cor. 15:32).  But because
    Jesus was resurrected, we must live a life using our time and resources to point people to Him.
    <strong>That is the only work that really lives on into eternity.  It is the only work that leads to
    a life not wasted.</strong>
</p>

<p>
     I hope you enjoyed the story!  Have you
    had any near-death experiences?  <strong>I would love to hear
    your story, or any other feedback, in the comments below or on Facebook.</strong><br></p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Syncing and Securing Accounts with Last Pass]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
    We always hear that our accounts are not secure because of bad passwords.  However, even using the same, memorable password for every account I make,
    I still have a hard time remembering how to log in to my accounts.
</p>
<h3>Last Pass to the Rescue</h3>
<img src="/img/tech/lastpass/lastpass-icon.png" />
<p>
    Last Pass is a password manager.  It stores any username/password combination you have for any given site inside its secure &quot;vault&quot;.
    To enter the vault, it requires one master password.  Once this password is entered, it will auto-fill any request for a username and
    password. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>This allows you to have many different passwords.</strong>  You only have to remember one master password, your &quot;last pass&quot;, and the
    rest will be filled out by the vault.  Last Pass also has a password generator, so you don&#39;t even have to come up with the password!  <strong>Anytime
    you are creating a new account, Last Pass will offer to generate your password and save the site.  The next time you go to log in
    to the site, Last Pass will fill it out for you.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This 1-minute video explains it very well.
</p>

<div class="fluid-width-video-wrapper" style="padding-top: 56.3333333333333%;">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RM0fzHxMASQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p><h3>Password Syncing is Awesome</h3></p>
<p>
    Password syncing is my favorite feature of Last Pass. The Last Pass vault
    is available through a browser extension, website, and app.  This is better than using a web browser&#39;s built in password functionality; if you
    save a password on your computer&#39;s browser, you can only load the saved information from that computer!  Your phone&#39;s browser will not haved the password saved!
    <strong>But if you sign in to your Last Pass vault, you can access any account credentials on any computer.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Even better, you can have multiple accounts saved for one site.  Previously, when I needed to log in to my
    wife&#39;s Gmail or Spotify account, or if she wanted to log in to our bank account, we would have to ask each other for the credentials.
    <strong>With Last Pass, we can both easily log in to any account one of us has created!</strong>
</p>

<p><h3>Is Password Security Important?</h3></p>
<p>
    I have never been hacked;  therefore, I have always had a hard time caring enough about securing passwords.  I&#39;ll never get hacked!...<strong>But,
    what if I did? What could happen?</strong>  Well, my money could be
    transferred to a different bank or PayPal account.  My Facebook account could be used to say horrible things to friends.  My email could be used as a
    spambot.  I could keep going.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>But what is worse, if an attacker gets one account, and you use the same email and password for everything...the attacker has all your accounts!</strong>
    After getting into one account, they can go to all the major banks, credit card companies, social media sites, and email sites, trying
    that email/password combination. They would get into any of the sites you have an account for!
</p>
<p>
    In fact, <a href="http://xkcd.com/792/">this xkcd comic</a> illustrates how some attackers set up websites for that very purpose!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>So yes, password security is important.</strong>
</p>

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3></p>
<p>
    I hope this post has at least made you consider securing your accounts.  Last Pass is a great option.  I highly recommend looking into it.
    However, there are many other great tools that accomplish the same goal.  <strong>If you use the same password for every site, take the time to
    look into a password manager and start securing your accounts.</strong>  It took me little effort, and I have already paid off the time through
    the password syncing!
</p>
<p>
    What do you think?  Do you want to start using Last Pass, or do you already use a different one?  Feel free to tell me about it below!  Also,
    if you have any more in-depth questions about Last Pass, ask away. I am happy to answer as best I can.

            <title><![CDATA[Jesus in the Old Testament - Introduction]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
    The Old Testament (OT) is an interesting set of books.  I can safely assume most Christians have not read the OT entirely, and
    I can definitely assume most Christians know and understand the New Testament (NT) better than the OT. I am among the latter group.
    And finally, some Christians likely only find benefit from it by it adds weight to the hardcover book, gaining arm strength lugging it around.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>However, there is amazing depth in the OT when it is read understanding its purpose.  I hope to explain that purpose, and in each further post in this series, explain
    an OT story, showing how that story meets the purpose.</strong>
</p>

<p><h3>What is the OT?</h3></p>
<p>
    Before delving into the purpose, let us briefly discuss what the OT is.  <strong>The OT is a series of books outlining the history of the Jewish nation and God&#39;s interactions with them.</strong>
    There are several different series that were written in similar ways with a similar mindset.  The series are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Books of the Law</strong> - Tells the story of creation, shows God choosing the Israelites, details them reaching the land He promises them (modern day Israel), and lists out
    the laws God gives them to follow, such as the Ten Commandments.</li>
    <li><strong>Books of History</strong> - Tells the story of the Israelites taking over the Promised Land and their ups and downs in following the laws of God up to around 400 B.C.</li>
    <li><strong>Books of Wisdom</strong> - Explains life proverbs, discusses the meaning of life, and contains prayers and songs of individuals to God.</li>
    <li><strong>Major Prophets</strong> -  Contains the words of God spoken through men to Israel, rebuking, foretelling judgement, and promising restoration after repentance.</li>
    <li><strong>Minor Prophets</strong> - Contains the same as above, but in (typically) shorter books.</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>What did the Jewish Nation Believe of the OT?</h3></p>
<p>
    Knowing what the OT contains, lets talk about why it was written.  <strong>Paul says that all Scripture is God-breathed and useful (1 Tim. 3:16-17).</strong>
    In Jesus&#39; time, the Jews held the OT in high esteem.  They strictly followed the laws and sacrifices
    listed in the books of the Law.  They sang the Psalms and searched out the meanings of the prophets.  <strong>They believed their salvation into eternal life
    rested within the scriptures.</strong>
</p>

<p><h3>Jesus&#39; Explanation of OT&#39;s Purpose</h3></p>
<p>
    And they were correct!  But many did not understand how the OT led to eternal life.    <strong>Jesus Himself calls them out, explaing
    that they have completely missed the OT&#39;s purpose.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    In John 5, the Pharisees -- the Jew&#39;s religious leaders -- ask Jesus who testifies with Him that
    He is the Christ.  Jesus tells them that John the Baptist testifies (Jn 1:29), His works testify (...all 4 gospels), and finally that the entire OT testifies:
</p>

<p><div></p>
<p><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
    You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life...
    Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father.  There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope.  For if you believed Moses, you would believe
    Me; for He wrote of me. (Jn 5:38-46)
</blockquote>
</div></p>
<p>
    The Pharisees knew entire OT in and out, but when Jesus came, they rejected Him!  <strong>Jesus tells them that if they truly believed what they were reading,
    they would not be rejecting Jesus; they would be worshipping Him!</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>So we see, the OT does point to eternal life because in its entirety -- every single letter -- it points to Jesus.</strong>  It details how we fall short of the glory of God,
    fail in our role as His image bearers, and desperately need a Savior.  It explains that from our failures we have earned the wrath of God, and that just
    as a murderer has to pay the penalty for breaking the law, we also must pay the penalty for rebelling against our Creator.  And finally, it points to the One
    who will come to save us; He will come, bear the wrath of God in our place, give us the chance to have His right standing before God, and reign as Lord over all.
    For a fuller picture of this, please read <a style="color: cornflowerblue;" title="The Offensive Gospel" href="/posts/offensive-gospel.html">this explanation
    of the Gospel from Romans 5</a>.
</p>

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3></p>
<p>
    I hope this post has excited you to see all the ways the OT points to Jesus.  <strong>Understanding this concept has deepened my love for the OT, and it always excites me
    when I find in it another picture of what Christ has done for us.</strong>  God always comes up with the best symbolism and parables.
</p>
