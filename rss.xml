            <title><![CDATA[First Post!]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody!  Thank you for coming to Tank Studios Blog.  My name is Ryan Tankersley 
and I&#39;ll be the author of these posts.  Feel free to check out the <a title="About Page" href="blog.tankstudios.net/about.html">About Page</a> to see what I&#39;m all about.</p>
<h3>Wait, Haven&#39;t You Done This Before?</h3>

<p>...Yeah.  The first one, Tank Studios Tech Talk, was a primer to see if I enjoyed blogging.  <strong>I did, but I felt limited</strong>. 
First, the blog never felt like mine.  I&#39;m a software developer.  I wanted the site to be mine in the sense that I knew the code.  Blogger gave me 
a nice, pre-packaged template that I liked, but again, it never felt like mine.  I made this website using <a title="DocPad" href="http://www.docpad.org/">DocPad</a>.
DocPad makes creating websites with Html, JavaScript, and CSS much easier than simply starting from scratch, and I can change anything on this site
that I want to.</p>
<p>Secondly, I desired a broader scope than just Tech Talk.  <strong>Here I will be discussing three core subjects: Life, Tech, and Dev</strong>.
Each subject will be tagged appropriately, so if a person only care about Life posts, that person can check the &quot;Life&quot; tag for all relevant posts.</p>
<p>Please allow me to explain each tag.</p>
<h4>Life</h4>

<p>The Life tag will be stories from my life.  I follow Jesus as Lord, and I love discussing what that looks like.  Many Life posts will be theological.
I also enjoy funny stories and would like to share entertaining experiences as they come.  <strong>I hope to allow people to walk through my life and
give glory to God through my thoughts, encouragements, and stories</strong>.</p>
<h4>Tech</h4>

<p>If you read much of Tank Studios Tech Talk, you will know what this involves.  In Tech, I will primarily be discussing interesting technology as I find it.
<strong>If a technology is useful in my life, I am sure it will be useful in somebody else&#39;s life</strong>.  I want to share that information in order to benefit you.</p>
<h4>Dev</h4>

<p>I expect this one to really only benefit software developers who stumble upon my site via Google.  In these I will be speaking of software development.
<strong>I may post about a problem I have solved or about a personal project I am working on</strong>.  Occasionally I have solved problems and that, &quot;I could write a blog post about that.&quot;
If I have that thought, now I can!</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There&#39;s the explanation for the new blog and the new site!  Please leave any feedback in a comment below!  Are there any topics you would like me to cover in the future?</p>
