      <p><h3>Welcome</h3>
This is the blog for Tank Studios!  Thank you for coming!</p>
<p><h3> Who I Am </h3>
My name is Ryan Tankersley.  I&#39;m the guy in the picture on the home page.  The beautiful woman next to me is my wife, Michelle. 
Yes, I am that lucky; I promise I didn&#39;t just photoshop myself into a picture with a supermodel. We live in Tulsa, Oklahoma with our cat Tessie.</p>
<p>The most important part of my life is my walk with Jesus Christ.  Since committing my life to Him in 2009, He has become the reason for all that I do...well, most of what I do. 
I mess up often.  But His grace is sufficient for me.  That grace has brought me life, and life in abundance.</p>
<p><h3> What I Do </h3>
Most of my day is spent developing software at a company called InterWorks.  I develop desktop applications in C#. Ever since my first &quot;Hello, World!&quot; Java app I have been hooked on programming. 
Programming opens up a whole new world of creativity.  I enjoy the creativity that developing spawns in me and the problems I get to solve during the process.</p>
<p>When I am not programming at work, I will be enjoying any number of activities.  I enjoy reading (mostly fantasy fiction), playing video games (mostly RPGs), playing instruments 
(mostly guitar...okay only guitar, I wanted to keep up the parallelism), and spending time with my friends and family.</p>
<p><h3>What is Tank Studios</h3>
Tank Studios is the company I haven&#39;t created yet. I may never create it. However, I often develop software, so for now this is a hub for any projects I actually finish. Also, I enjoy writing, so I decided to use the name for my blog as well.</p>
<p><h3>Thank You</h3>
Thank you again for visiting my blog!  I hope you enjoy your time here.  Feel free to contact me at ry.tankersley@gmail.com with any questions or suggestions.</p>
