      <p><h1 id="heading1">Welcome</h1>
This is the blog for Tank Studios!  Thank you for coming!</p>
<p><h1> Who I Am </h1>
My name is Ryan Tankersley.  I&#39;m the guy in the picture.  The beautiful women next to me is my wife, Michelle.<br>Yes, I am that lucky; I promise I didn&#39;t just photoshop myself into a picture with a supermodel. We live in Tulsa, Oklahoma with our cat Tessie.</p>
<p>The most important part of my life is my walk with Jesus Christ.  Since committing my life to Him in 2009, He has become the reason for all that I do...well, most of what I do.<br>I mess up a good amount.  But His grace is sufficient for me.  That grace has brought me life, and life in abundance.</p>
<p><h1> What I do </h1>
Most of my day is spent developing software at a company called InterWorks.  I develop desktop applications in C#. Ever since my first &quot;Hello, World!&quot; java app I have been hooked on programming.<br>Programming opens up a whole new world of creativity.  I enjoy the creativity developing spawns in me and the problems I get to solve during the process.</p>
<p>When I am not programming at work, I will be enjoying any number of activities.  I enjoy reading (mostly fantasy fiction), playing video games (mostly RPGs), playing instruments 
(mostly guitar...okay only guitar, I wanted to keep up the parallelism), and spending time with my friends and family.</p>
<p><h1>What is Tank Studios</h1>
Tank Studios is the name for the company I haven&#39;t created yet.  I may never create it.  However, I like to program, and I wanted a hub for any software projects that I actually finish.
Also, I sometimes enjoy writing, so I decided to create my software project hub as well as create a blog.</p>
<p><h1>Thank You</h1>
Thank you again for visiting my blog!  I hope you enjoy your time here.  Feel free to contact me at ry.tankersley@gmail.com with any questions or suggestions.</p>
